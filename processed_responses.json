For hex number 66666 hex, value is 0x66666. Convert to decimal? But easier: 5 hex digits -> 5*4=20 bits, but leading zeros may not be needed. The most significant hex digit is '6' which is binary 0110. Since it's not zero, the leftmost bit is 0? Actually 6 hex is 0110 binary, so the leading bit is 0, but that's okay? The first hex digit 6 corresponds to 4 bits: 0110. The highest bit is 0? The most significant bit of the number is the leftmost 1 in the binary representation. For hex digit 6 (0110), the most significant bit of the entire number is the leftmost '0', but that's not significant; the next bit is 1. So we need to find the position of the highest 1. For hex 6, binary 0110 -> highest 1 at bit position 2? Actually bits: from leftmost of 4 bits: bit3=0, bit2=1, bit1=1, bit0=0. So the first significant bit is at position 2 (counting from 0). So number of bits needed = highest position + 1. For 5 hex digits, we have 4*5=20 bits. But the leading 4 bits for the first digit: 0110; the leading zero may be omitted. So the total bits = 20 - 1 = 19? Wait: The 5th hex digit is the most significant: 6 => binary 0110. So the first bit of that digit is 0, so we can drop that leading zero. So we have 3 significant bits from that digit plus the remaining 4 digits each 4 bits -> 4*4 = 16 bits. So total significant bits = 3 + 16 = 19. Answer: 19.",

The most significant bit of that hex digit is 0 (the 8's place). But we don't include leading zeros. So the first 1 appears at bit position 2 of that 4-bit group (counting from 0?).

We can convert hex to binary. Each hex digit is 4 bits. If the most significant hex digit is non-zero, number of bits = (#hex digits *4) minus leading zeros. But need to check if the most significant hex digit's highest bit may be zero. The hex digits: 6 6 6 6 6. Each hex digit is 0110. So the binary string would be 0110 0110 0110 0110 0110. That's 5 digits *4=20 bits. But the leading 0 bit can be omitted. The first hex digit is 6, which in binary is 0110. So the most significant bit is 0, so we can drop it. So we have 3 bits from the first digit? Actually 6 (0110) has only bits at positions 4-1? 0110 is bits: 0*8 +1*4+1*2+0*1 = 6. So the leading zero bit makes the most significant bit 0. So the total significant bits: 4*5-1=19 bits. Wait, but we need to check if any leading zeros beyond first hex digit? The first hex digit 6 has leading zero in its 4-bit group. So the binary representation would start with 1? Actually 0110 -> leading zero then 110. So the first non-zero bit is the one corresponding to 4's place. So the first '1' is in the second bit from left. So the length of binary representation is 4*5-1=19 bits. Let's verify: 6 hex -> 0110. So the binary string: 0110 0110 0110 0110 0110. That's 20 bits. Dropping leading 0 gives 19 bits. So answer: 19.",

Convert to decimal: each hex digit 6. Value = 6*16^4 + 6*16^3 + 6*16^2 + 6*16^1 + 6*16^0. Compute: 16^0=1, 16^1=16, 16^2=256, 16^3=4096, 16^4=65536. Multiply by 6: 6*65536=393216; 6*4096=24576; 6*256=1536; 6*16=96; 6*1=6. Sum: 393216+24576=417792; +1536=419328; +96=419424; +6=419430. So decimal = 419430. Now find number of binary digits needed to represent 419430. Find highest power of 2 <= 419430. 2^19=524288 >, 2^18=262144 <=. So need 19 bits? Wait 2^19=524288 >419430. So highest power less than 419430 is 2^18=262144. So number is between 2^18 and 2^19-1. So bits needed = 19? Actually if number is less than 2^19, it uses up to 19 bits? For example, 2^18 <= n < 2^19: need 19 bits to represent? Let's check: For numbers less than 2^k, need k bits to represent? For n=2^k-1 uses k bits. For n=2^k-1, highest bit is k-1. For n between 2^(k-1) and 2^k-1 inclusive, need k bits. Since 419430 < 2^19 but >=2^18, it needs 19 bits. Yes.\n\nThus answer 19.",
