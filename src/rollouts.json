    "The hex number 66666 equals 6·(16⁴+16³+16²+16+1)=6·69905=419430 in decimal. Its binary logarithm is between 18 and 19 because 2¹⁸=262,144 and 2¹⁹=524,288, so the representation needs 19 bits. Hence the base‑2 representation has 19 digits.",
    "Each hex digit corresponds to 4 binary bits, so five hex digits give 20 bits.  \nHowever the leading hex digit is 6 (binary 0110), whose leading 0 is omitted in the normal binary representation.  \nThus we have 3 bits for the first digit and 4 bits for each of the remaining four digits: 3 + 4·4 = 19 bits.",
