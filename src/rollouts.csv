"Solve this problem step by step:
When the base-16 number 66666 is written in base 2, how
many base-2 digits (bits) does it have?

Think step-by-step, but limit your reasoning within the <thought> tags to 3 sentences! Don't spend lots of time thinking; I need a quick answer.",,"<thought>
To find the number of binary digits of the hex number 0x66666, note that each hex digit equals 4 bits, so 5 digits would give up to 20 bits.  
Because the most significant hex digit is 6 (binary 0110), the leading zero can be omitted, leaving a leading 1 in the second position of that nibble.  
Thus the highest set bit is at position 18 (counting from 0), so the binary representation uses 19 bits.
