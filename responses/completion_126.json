  "cot_content": "We need to find binary representation length of hex number 66666 (base 16). Interpret: 66666_hex = hex digits '6','6','6','6','6' => in hex each digit 4 bits. So this hex number is 5 hex digits => up to 20 bits. But leading hex digit is '6' which is binary 0110. So the most significant bits are 0110... But leading zero might drop. So length equals 4*5=20 bits minus leading zeros? Actually highest digit '6' is binary 0110, which has leading 0. But we consider the number value: 6 * 16^4 + ... etc. Its binary representation will have leading 1 somewhere after the leading zero? Let's compute value: 0x66666 = decimal? compute: 6*16^4 + 6*16^3 + 6*16^2 + 6*16 + 6. 16^4=65536. 6*65536=393216. 16^3=4096. 6*4096=24576. 16^2=256. 6*256=1536. 16=16. 6*16=96. +6. Sum: 393216+24576=417792. +1536=419328. +96=419424. +6=419430. So decimal value 419430. Binary length: Find highest power of 2 <= 419430. 2^19=524288 too high. 2^18=262144. 2^19 too high. So most significant bit position 18 (0-indexed). So number of bits = 19. Because bits 18 down to 0 inclusive count 19 bits. So answer 19.",
