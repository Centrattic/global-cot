Each hex digit is 4 bits -> total bits = 5*4 =20. But leading zeros might be omitted. First hex digit 6 (0110) has leading zero omitted? In binary, 0110 is 6. If we write full, it's 0 1 1 0. But leading zero can be omitted, so first digit reduces length by 1. So bits length = 20-1=19? Wait: hex 6 is 0110; the most significant bit is 0. So the binary representation would start with 110... Actually 6 hex corresponds 010110? Let's compute: 0x6 = decimal 6. Binary of 6 = 110. That's 3 bits. So hex 6 as a digit yields 3 bits. For 5 hex digits, bits = 3 + 4*4 = 3 +16 =19. Thus answer 19.",
