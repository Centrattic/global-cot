But leading zeros may reduce? But hex digit '6' is nonzero. So number has 5 hex digits, each 4 bits, but the most significant hex digit is 6 (binary 0110). So the first hex digit has 4 bits, but leading zero bits could be omitted. The first hex digit 6 is binary 0110, highest bit is 0. So the most significant 1 is at bit position 2 (starting from 0). So total bits: 5*4=20 bits, but topmost bit is 0, so actual number of bits is 20-1 =19? Wait consider hex 6 = 0110. The most significant bit among the 20 bits would be at position 1 (0-index). So representation has 19 bits. So answer: 19.",
