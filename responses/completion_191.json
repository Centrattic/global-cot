Sum: 6*65536=393216; 6*4096=24576; 6*256=1536; 6*16=96; plus 6=6. Total=393216+24576=417792; +1536=419328; +96=419424; +6=419430. So value = 419430 decimal. Need number of bits in binary representation: find highest power of 2 <= that number. 2^19=524288; 2^18=262144; 2^19 too high. 2^18=262144 <=419430. 2^19=524288 >. So highest power 2^18; thus need 19 bits? Wait if number is between 2^18 and 2^19-1 inclusive, binary requires 19 bits. Because if number < 2^18, would need 18 bits. Since 419430 > 262144 and < 524288, requires 19 bits. Answer 19.",
