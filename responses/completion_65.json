In decimal that is? each hex digit corresponds to 4 bits. So number of bits = number of hex digits * 4 = 5*4=20 bits. But we must consider leading zeros? Represented as hex number 0x66666. In binary, length may be less than 20 if leading bits are zero. But hex digits have 4 bits each. The first digit is '6' which in binary is 0110. That has leading zero. So the most significant 4 bits: 0110. The leading zero may reduce total bits by 1? The first hex digit '6' is 0110. So the binary representation will start with '110' after dropping leading zero. So first digit contributes 3 bits, not 4. So total bits = 5*4 - 1 = 19? Let's compute: 0x6 = 0110. So if we drop leading zero, we have 3 bits. So 19 bits total. Also need to check if any further leading zeros? 0x66666 has no leading zeros. So answer 19.",
