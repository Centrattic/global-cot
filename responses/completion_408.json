But leading zero bits may be omitted; highest hex digit 6 has binary 0110 (since 6 hex = decimal 6). The most significant hex digit is 6, which binary 0110. Leading zero bit is leading 0? But in hex representation, first digit 6 has binary 0110, but when writing number, leading zeros omitted; so the first bit is 0? Actually 6 hex corresponds to binary 0110; the leading zero is not considered as a significant bit. So effective number of bits is 3? Actually 6 hex is 0110, but the leading 0 can be omitted to get 110. So the highest hex digit 6 in most significant position: its binary bits are 110 (3 bits). So total bits: 3 + 4*4 = 3+16=19 bits. Wait check: 5 hex digits: first digit 6 => binary 110; then each subsequent digit 6 => 4 bits each: 110 + 4*4=110+16=??
