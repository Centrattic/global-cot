Compute: 16^0=1, 16^1=16, 16^2=256, 16^3=4096, 16^4=65536. Sum = 1+16+256+4096+65536 = 699? Wait sum: 1+16=17; +256=273; +4096=4369; +65536=69905? Let's sum: 17+256=273. 273+4096=4369. 4369+65536=69905. Yes sum = 69905. Multiply by 6: 69905*6 = 419430? Let's compute: 69905*6 = 69905*3*2. 69905*3=209715; times 2 = 419430. Indeed 69905*6 = 419430. So number is 419430 decimal. Now need number of bits to represent that in binary. Highest power of 2 less than or equal. Compute log2(419430). 2^19 = 524288. 2^18 = 262144. 419430 between 2^18 and 2^19. So need 19 bits to represent? Actually if value < 2^19, you need 19 bits? Let's check: For binary representation, number of bits needed = floor(log2(n))+1. Compute log2(419430). Since 419430 in binary? 419430 = 2*209715? 209715 = 2^18 -1? Wait 2^18=262144. 209715 is 2^18 - 52429? Not helpful. Let's compute log2 precisely: 2^18=262144; 2^19=524288. So 419430 is between, so floor=18. So bits needed = 19. So answer 19.",
