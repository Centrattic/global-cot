So 5 hex digits => maximum 20 bits. But leading digit is 6 which is binary 0110. So first hex digit 6 => bits 0110. So overall bits: 5 hex digits *4 =20 bits, but leading zeros may be omitted. The first hex digit '6' in binary is 0110, but the leading zero could be omitted. So the first hex digit is 6 (binary 0110). The most significant bit of hex 6 is 0? Actually 6 in hex is decimal 6, binary 110. But padded to 4 bits: 0110. So the most significant bit of the entire number is the first 0 of that 0110? But we can discard leading zeros. So the first non-zero bit is the second bit of the 4 bits? Wait: 0110 has leading 0 then 110. So the first non-zero bit is the second bit. So the total number of bits is 4*5-1=19? Let's check: If we have 5 hex digits, 20 bits raw. The most significant hex digit is 6 => 0110. Dropping the leading zero gives 110. That's 3 bits from that hex digit. Then add remaining 4*4=16 bits from the other four hex digits. So total bits=3+16=19. So answer 19.",
