So number 66666 hex = digits: 6 6 6 6 6. Each '6' in hex = binary 0110. But leading digit 6 (non-zero) so 5 hex digits => 5*4=20 bits. However we must check if the most significant hex digit is 6, binary 0110. Leading zero can be omitted, but the first hex digit is 6, which in binary is 0110, but the leading 0 can be omitted? Actually the value of 6 hex is 0110 binary but as a 4-bit group, the leading zero is part of representation but we could drop it? For example, hex \"6\" = decimal 6, binary 110. So the 4-bit group 0110 has a leading zero that is unnecessary. So the total bits may be less than 20. Let's compute actual binary representation: hex 6=110. So each '6' yields 3 bits? Wait: hex 6 (decimal 6) binary is 110. So each '6' gives 3 bits. For 5 hex digits, 5*3=15 bits. But there may be some leading zeros: the first hex digit 6 gives binary \"110\". So the first digit corresponds to 3 bits. Next digits each give 3 bits. So total 15 bits. Let's verify: hex \"6\" = decimal 6 => binary 110 (3 bits). So 5 of them => 15 bits. So answer: 15.",
