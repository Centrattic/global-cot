But leading bits may be zero? Highest hex digit is 6 non-zero. So binary representation will have 5 hex digits *4 = 20 bits, but leading zeros maybe? The first hex digit is 6 (binary 0110). So the most significant bits: 0110 leading zero? The first bit maybe zero but still counted? For length, we count bits up to most significant 1. 6 hex digit binary 0110: leading 0 then 110. So bits: 0110 0110 0110 0110 0110. The leading zero maybe not counted if we consider minimal representation. The first digit 6 binary 0110 has leading zero which is not significant. So representation: 1100110011001100110? Actually 6 in hex = 0110. So first digit 0110, but leading zero omitted. So first hex digit 6 yields binary 110. So 3 bits. Then remaining 4 hex digits each 4 bits. So total bits = 3 + 4*4 = 3+16=19 bits. But check if any leading zeros? Yes first digit 6 has binary 0110, leading zero omitted. So answer 19.",
