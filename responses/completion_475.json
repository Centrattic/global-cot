  "cot_content": "We need to convert hex 66666 (base 16) to binary length. In hex, each hex digit corresponds to 4 bits. But leading zeros omitted. hex digits: '6','6','6','6','6'. That's 5 hex digits. Each hex digit yields 4 bits = 20 bits. However leading hex digit '6' has binary 0110, but leading zero may be omitted. The highest hex digit '6' is 0110 (4 bits). The highest bit of that is 0? Actually 6 is 0110, most significant bit is 0 so effectively the first bit is 0 and can be dropped. So the first hex digit yields 3 significant bits. So total bits: 3 + 4*4 = 3 + 16 = 19 bits. So answer 19. Ensure no other leading zeros from other digits. Yes.",
