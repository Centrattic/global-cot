So hex representation: digits: 6 6 6 6 6 - five hex digits, each 4 bits, but leading zeros may be omitted. The most significant hex digit is 6, which is 0110. So the binary representation will be 4*5=20 bits, but the leading zeros of the first digit maybe omitted: 0110 -> leading zero omitted, giving 3 bits? But need to consider that the leading digit is 6, which binary 110 (3 bits) if leading zero omitted. So total bits = 3 + 4*4 = 3+16=19 bits. Wait check: hex 6 = decimal 6. Binary of 6 is 110. So hex 66666 has 5 hex digits. Binary length =? For each hex digit, 4 bits but leading zeros in most significant nibble may be omitted. For nibble 6 (0110). So effective bits = 3 + 4*4 = 19.\n\nThus answer 19 bits.",
