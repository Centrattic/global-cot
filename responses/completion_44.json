  "cot_content": "We need to convert hex number 66666 (hex) to binary length. 66666 hex digits: 6 6 6 6 6. Each hex digit is 4 bits. But leading zeros may not count. So number of bits = 5*4 = 20 bits. But if leading digit is 6 (binary 0110), but leading hex digit not zero, so 5 hex digits => 20 bits. However, leading hex digit 6 is 0110, leading bit 0 could be omitted. But we count significant bits: 6 hex digit leading 6 has binary 110. Wait 6 hex is 0110 (4 bits). Highest non-zero bit is the third bit from right? Actually 6 hex = binary 0110. The leading 0 can be omitted, giving 3 bits (110). So for 5 hex digits, but first digit 6 gives 3 bits, others 4 bits each. So total bits =3 +4*4=3+16=19 bits. Let's verify: hex 66666 = 0x66666. In binary: 6=0110, so first digit 6 => 0110? But leading zero removed. So bits: first digit contributes 3 bits. Others 4 bits each. So total 3+4*4=19 bits. Check with decimal? 0x66666 = 6*16^4+6*16^3+6*16^2+6*16+6 = 6*(65536+4096+256+16+1)=6*69905=419430? compute: 69905*6=419430. Binary of 419430? 419430= 2^19? 2^19=524288. 2^18=262144. 419430 between, so requires 19 bits. Yes. So answer 19.",
