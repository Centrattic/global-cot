But leading hex digits may not use all 4 bits. Determine highest hex digit 6 => binary 0110. Leading digit 6 -> binary 0110, so leading bit is 0, meaning topmost bit maybe 0? Actually 6 hex corresponds to 0110 binary of 4 bits. Highest bit of that 4-bit group is 0. So overall binary length less than 20. We need find total bits needed to represent the number in binary.\n\nCompute decimal value: hex 6 6 6 6 6 = 6*16^4 + 6*16^3 + 6*16^2 + 6*16 + 6.\n\n16^4=65536; 16^3=4096; 16^2=256; 16=16.\n\nCompute: 6*65536=393216\n6*4096=24576\n6*256=1536\n6*16=96\n6=6\nSum: 393216+24576=417792\n+1536=419328\n+96=419424\n+6=419430\n\nSo decimal 419430. Now binary representation of 419430. Find highest power of 2 less than or equal: 2^19=524288 >419430; 2^18=262144 <=419430. So highest bit position 18 (0-indexed) meaning need 19 bits? Actually number of bits needed is floor(log2(n))+1. log2(419430) ~? 419430/262144=1.6. So log2 ~18.something. floor=18. So need 19 bits. So answer 19.",
