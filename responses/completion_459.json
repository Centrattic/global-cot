  "cot_content": "We need to find number of bits in binary representation of hex number 66666 (hex). 66666 hex. Convert to decimal? Let's compute.\n\nHex digits: 6 6 6 6 6. Each hex digit is 4 bits. So 5 digits => 5*4=20 bits maximum, but leading zeros may reduce. But the most significant digit is 6, which is binary 0110 (4 bits). So leading digit not zero. So total bits = 4*5=20. But check leading zeros: hex digit 6 is 0110, leading bit is 0, but it's still 4 bits? Actually 0 leading not counted? For representation we don't include leading zeros. So the first digit '6' has binary 110? Wait 6 hex = 0110. The most significant bit of that group is 0, so the actual binary representation may start with 110 (3 bits). But since it's hex digit, the leading zero could be omitted. So the first 4-bit group is 0110, but the leading 0 might be omitted, leaving 110 (3 bits). But we must consider the next digits. So let's write full binary: Each hex digit 6 => binary 0110. So full binary string: 0110 0110 0110 0110 0110. That's 20 bits, with first 0 leading zero. Remove that leading zero => 19 bits? Let's check: The first group 0110 => leading zero omitted, giving 110. So first group contributes 3 bits. The remaining four groups each have 4 bits and start with 0? Actually each group 0110, but no leading zero? For group 0110, the leading zero may be omitted, but the next digit 0? But the group itself may have leading zero omitted, but we need to consider entire representation. Let's write full binary: \n01100110011001100110.\n\nNow remove leading zero: 1100110011001100110. Count bits: that's 19. So answer 19.",
