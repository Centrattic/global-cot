  "cot_content": "We have hexadecimal number 66666 (base 16). We need to find its value in decimal: interpret as hex digits: 6 6 6 6 6. Each hex digit is 4 bits. The leftmost digit 6 (most significant) is 6*16^4. 16^4=65536. So 6*65536 = 393216. Next digit 6*16^3 = 6*4096=24576. Next 6*256=1536. Next 6*16=96. Next 6*1=6. Sum: 393216+24576=417792. +1536=419328. +96=419424. +6=419430. So the decimal value is 419430. We need number of bits in binary representation. Find floor(log2(n))+1. Let's compute: 2^18=262144, 2^19=524288. So 419430 between. So highest power of 2 less than or equal is 2^18=262144. Next 2^19=524288 >. So the msb position is 18 (0-index). Number of bits = 19 (since positions 0..18). But check: if n=419430, we can check binary: 419430 decimal in binary: Let's compute quickly. 419430 = 419430. 419430-262144=157286. 157286-131072=26214? Wait 157286-131072=26214. 26214-16384=982? Wait compute: 26214-16384=982? no 26214-16384=982? Actually 26214-16384=982? Wait that's wrong. Let's compute carefully: 419430-262144=157286. 157286-131072=26214. 26214-65536? no too high. Let's just compute binary length. Since 2^19=524288 > n > 2^18. So highest power 2^18. That means binary representation has 19 bits. Because the most significant bit at position 18 (0-index). So answer: 19 bits.",
