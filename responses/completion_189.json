Wait question: \"When the base-16 number 66666 is written in base 2, how many base-2 digits (bits) does it have?\" So number 0x66666. In hex digits: 6 6 6 6 6. Each hex digit corresponds to 4 bits. So 5 hex digits => 20 bits. But leading zeros maybe? Hex 6=0110 binary. So representation: 5 hex digits each 4 bits produce 20 bits. But leading zeros may appear? Since first digit 6 is not zero, high bit 0? 6 in binary 0110, so most significant bit is 0? Actually 6 decimal = 0110 (4 bits). The most significant bit among those 4 bits is 0. So the number will actually have 19 bits? Wait we need to count bits needed to represent number without leading zeros. The leading zeros before the first 1 can be omitted. For hex 6 -> binary 0110, leading zero can be omitted, giving 3 bits? Wait 6 decimal binary is 110. Actually 6 decimal is binary 110 (3 bits). So first hex digit 6 corresponds to binary 110. So we have 3 bits for first digit, then 4 bits for each subsequent 6's. So total bits: 3 + 4*4 = 3 + 16 = 19 bits. So answer 19.",
