But leading digit '6' is 0110 so first bit 0 maybe not counted? We need how many binary digits (bits) in its binary representation (without leading zeros). Hex 6 = binary 110. So hex digit '6' = 0110 but leading zero omitted. So first digit contributes 3 bits. Remaining 4 digits each 4 bits = 4*4=16. Total 3+16=19 bits. So answer 19.",
