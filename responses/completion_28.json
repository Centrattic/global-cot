Let's compute.\n\nHex 6 6 6 6 6. In hex digits: each hex digit is 4 bits. So the length in bits is 5 digits * 4 = 20 bits possible, but leading bits may not be all used. Need to compute the highest power of 2 less than or equal to the number.\n\nHex 6 = decimal 6. So number = 6*16^4 + 6*16^3 + 6*16^2 + 6*16^1 + 6*16^0.\n\nCompute: 16^0=1, 16^1=16, 16^2=256, 16^3=4096, 16^4=65536.\n\nSo value = 6*(65536+4096+256+16+1) = 6*(65536+4096=69632? Wait sum: 65536+4096=69632. Add 256 => 69888. Add 16 => 69904. Add 1 => 69905. Multiply by 6: 69905*6 = 419430? Let's compute: 69905*6 = 69905*5=349525, plus 69905=419430. Yes 419430.\n\nSo number is 419430 decimal. Find number of bits needed: need smallest k such that 2^{k-1} <= n < 2^k. We can compute log2: log2(419430) approximate. 2^19 = 524288. 2^18 = 262144. So 419430 is between 2^18 and 2^19. So it requires 19 bits.\n\nThus answer: 19.",
