Convert to decimal or directly find bit length.\n\nHex digits: 6 6 6 6 6. Each hex digit is 4 bits. So 5 digits => 20 bits. But leading zeros? The first digit is 6, non-zero, so 5 hex digits -> 20 binary digits. But maybe some leading zeros in binary? No, representation will have exactly 20 bits, except leading zeros omitted. Since first hex digit 6 is 0110? Actually hex 6 is 0110 binary (4 bits). So full binary string: 0110 0110 0110 0110 0110. That's 20 bits. But leading zero can be omitted? The first hex digit 6 has binary 0110; leading zero could be omitted, giving 19 bits? Wait hex \"6\" -> binary \"110\" if we omit leading zero. But when concatenating 5 hex digits, we might ignore leading zeros of the first digit. For hex 6, the most significant bit is 1 (since 6=110). So the total bits = 4*5 - 1 = 19? Let's check: For hex digit 6 (binary 0110), the leading zero can be omitted, giving 3 bits \"110\". So the first digit contributes 3 bits. Others contribute 4 bits each. So total bits = 3 + 4*4 = 3+16=19. Wait 4 other digits, each 4 bits. That's 19. So answer 19.",
