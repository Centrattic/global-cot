  "cot_content": "We need to convert hex number 66666 (base 16) to base 2. In hex digits: 6,6,6,6,6. Each hex digit is 4 bits. So 5 hex digits => 5*4=20 bits. But if leading ones are zero? The number 66666 hex has most significant digit 6, which is binary 0110. Leading zeros can be omitted, but the most significant hex digit is 6 (non-zero), representation will have 4 bits for that digit, but the leading bit is 0? Actually hex digit 6 = binary 0110 (4 bits). So the leading digit 6 has binary 0110, but the leading zero can be omitted? Typically representation doesn't include leading zeros. So we have bits: 0110 0110 0110 0110 0110. This is 20 bits but the first digit's leading zero could be omitted giving 19 bits? Let's check: The most significant hex digit is 6, binary 0110. The leading zero is not significant; the first '1' occurs at second bit of that group? So the binary representation would start with '110' (since leading zero omitted). Wait: hex 6 = decimal 6. In binary 6 = 110. That's 3 bits. So the full number in binary would be combination of 5 hex digits: each 4 bits but leading zeros omitted. For first hex digit 6 (110), that's 3 bits. For each of the remaining 4 hex digits 6, each has 4 bits representation 0110 but leading zero omitted? They would be 0110 but the leading zero can be omitted as well? Actually each of them is 6, which is binary 110. That is 3 bits. So total bits: 3 (first) + 4*3 = 12 => 15 bits? Wait second digits 6 as 0110 but leading zero omitted gives 110. So each 6 gives 3 bits. So 5 digits *3 bits =15 bits. So answer 15. Let's double-check: hex 66666 hex => decimal? Not needed. But to be safe, compute binary: 6=0110 => but if we write 6 as 0110, the leading zero omitted gives 110. So 5*3=15 bits. So answer 15.",
