Each digit is 4 bits. So 5 hex digits -> up to 20 bits. But leading digit is 6, which is 0110. So highest hex digit =6. The binary length may be less than 20 if leading bits zero. Let's compute value: hex 6 6 6 6 6 = 6*16^4 + 6*16^3 + 6*16^2 + 6*16 + 6.\n\nCompute powers: 16^1=16; 16^2=256; 16^3=4096; 16^4=65536.\n\nCompute: 6*65536 = 393216\n6*4096 = 24576\n6*256 = 1536\n6*16 = 96\n6*1 = 6\n\nSum: 393216+24576=417792; plus 1536=419328; plus 96=419424; plus 6=419430.\n\nSo decimal 419430. Now find binary length. Binary of 419430. Find highest power of 2 <= value. 2^19 = 524288 > 419430. 2^18 = 262144. 2^19 bigger, so highest power less is 2^18=262144. So binary representation will have bits up to 18th index (starting from 0). The length = floor(log2(419430))+1. log2(419430) ~? 2^18 =262144; 2^19=524288. So between 18 and 19. So length=19 bits? Wait floor(log2)=18, plus 1 => 19 bits. So answer: 19.",
