Usually length equals number of bits needed to represent value, excluding leading zeros. Since hex digits all non-zero? hex '6' is 0110. The most significant digit 6 is non-zero so highest bit is 0? Wait 6 is 0110 binary, leading bit 0? But we consider as 4-bit chunk but leading zero may count? For number, representation uses minimal length. So top digit 6 has binary 0110, but leading zero may be omitted. So the most significant bit is 0? Actually 6 decimal = 0110 binary of 4 bits, but leading zero not counted. So the most significant bit is 1? Wait 0110 => bits 0 1 1 0. Highest bit is 0? The actual value of hex 6 is 6 decimal. It has binary 110. That's 3 bits. So we only need 3 bits for each hex digit except maybe leading zeros omitted. So overall? Let's compute: hex 66666 = decimal? Not needed. Let's compute binary length: For hex digit 6 (decimal 6) -> binary 110 (3 bits). So representation of each hex digit: first digit 6 -> 3 bits. Then each subsequent digit append 4 bits each (since intermediate digits). For example number hex 66666: first digit 6: binary 110, then next 6: 4 bits 0110, etc. So total bits = 3 + 4*4 = 3 +16 =19 bits. So answer 19.",
