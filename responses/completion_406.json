Most significant digit is 6 (binary 0110). That has leading zero bit but still counts? Number of bits in binary representation usually count from most significant 1 to least. For hex 6 = binary 110. Since 6 hex digit is 0110. But leading zero not counted. So bits for 6 hex digit: 3 bits (110). So total bits = 3 + 4*4? Wait each of remaining four 6's produce 4 bits each? For each 6 hex digit, binary representation: 0110. For high-order one, leading zero removed, so 3 bits. For others, full 4 bits. So total bits = 3 + 4*4 = 3 + 16 = 19. Check: 5 hex digits => decimal value? Not needed. So answer 19.",
