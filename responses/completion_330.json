But leading zeros? Highest hex digit is 6 which is non-zero so highest bit is 2^? 6 hex = 0110. So the most significant hex digit 6 corresponds to bits 0110. So top bit is 0? The first hex digit 6 has binary 0110, but leading zero may be omitted. So actual number of bits could be 19? Let's check: hex 6 = binary 110. So the first digit 6 is 3 bits, not 4. So the total bits = (first digit 6) 3 bits + 4 bits for each of remaining 4 digits = 3 + 4*4 = 3+16=19. So answer 19 bits.",
