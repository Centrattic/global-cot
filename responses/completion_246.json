But leading digit is 6 (binary 0110). So first digit 6 (0110). Leading zeros not counted. So first non-zero bit is at position 4? Actually 6 binary: 0110. The leading zero can be dropped. So effective length = 4 bits per hex digit? Actually 6 in hex is 0110. Highest bit of 6 is bit 3 (0-index). So 6 as 4-bit pattern: 0110. So first bit is at position 3. So number of bits = 4*5 -1? Wait compute: hex 6 repeated 5 times: value = 6*16^4 +6*16^3+... etc.\n\nWe can compute max power: 16^4 = 65536. So leading digit 6 => 6*65536 = 393216. That is decimal. Highest power is 2^18=262144, 2^19=524288. So 393216 is between 2^18 and 2^19. So need 19 bits? 2^18=262144, 2^19=524288. 393216<524288. So highest power is 2^18=262144. So number of bits = floor(log2(393216))+1 = 18+1=19 bits. Check maybe 19 bits.\n\nAnswer: 19.",
