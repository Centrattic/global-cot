  "cot_content": "We need to convert hex number 66666 hex to binary length. This hex number 0x66666. Compute its decimal value. 6*16^4 +6*16^3+6*16^2+6*16+6. Compute powers: 16^0=1, 16^1=16, 16^2=256, 16^3=4096, 16^4=65536. Sum: 6*65536=393216; +6*4096=24576 => 417792; +6*256=1536 => 419328; +6*16=96 => 419424; +6*1=6 => 419430. So decimal 419430. Now find binary length: need smallest k such that 2^(k-1) <=419430 <2^k. Compute powers: 2^19=524288, 2^18=262144. 419430 between, so need 20 bits? Since 2^18=262144, 2^19=524288. 419430 >262144, so need 19 bits? Wait if highest power less than number is 2^18=262144. But number 419k >262144, so needs 19 bits? Actually if number <2^19, then it fits in 19 bits. But 2^18 is 262144; 2^19 is 524288. Since 419430 <524288, the binary representation uses 19 bits (since highest power 2^18). Count bits: from 2^18 down to 2^0 inclusive -> total 19 bits. So answer 19.",
