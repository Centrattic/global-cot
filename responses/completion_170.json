  "cot_content": "We need to convert hex number 66666 (base 16) to binary length. Each hex digit corresponds to 4 binary digits. But leading zeros may not count. Number 66666 hex. That's 5 hex digits. The highest hex digit is '6', which in binary is 0110. So the most significant bit is the first bit of that representation: 0 1 1 0. The first hex digit '6' corresponds to 4 bits: 0110. The leading bit is 0, but we drop leading zeros. So the first non-zero bit is the second bit of that 4-bit group: '1'. So the binary length will be 4*5 - 1 = 19? Wait compute: 5 hex digits -> 20 bits. But the most significant hex digit '6' has binary '0110', leading zero removed gives 3 bits from that group. So total bits: 3 + 4*4 = 3+16=19. Thus answer 19 bits.\n\nCheck: 66666 hex = 6*16^4 + 6*16^3 + 6*16^2 + 6*16 +6. Let's compute value in decimal: 16^0=1, 16^1=16, 16^2=256, 16^3=4096, 16^4=65536. So value = 6*65536 + 6*4096 + 6*256 + 6*16 + 6 = 393216 + 24576 + 1536 + 96 + 6 = 420? let's sum: 393216+24576=417792; +1536=419328; +96=419424; +6=419430. So decimal 419430. Binary length? Highest power of 2 less than number? 2^18=262144, 2^19=524288. So number <524288 >262144 so highest bit at 19th position (0-index). So binary length 19 bits. Good.\n\nAnswer: 19.",
