So number of binary digits is 5*4=20 bits, but leading zeros maybe? The most significant digit is 6 (binary 0110). 6 in hex is 0110 in binary. So the most significant bit is 0? Wait 6 hex is 0110 binary, but leading zero may be omitted. So the binary representation may be 4 bits but first bit could be 0. The actual number: hex 6 = decimal 6, so binary 110. But representation may not include leading zeros. So the total bits? Let's compute decimal value: 6*16^4 + 6*16^3 + 6*16^2 + 6*16 + 6. 16^4=65536. 6*65536=393,216. 16^3=4096*6=24,576. 16^2=256*6=1,536. 16*6=96. +6. Sum=393,216+24,576=417,792; +1,536=419,328; +96=419,424; +6=419,430. Decimal 419430.\n\nNow find binary length: find highest power of 2 less than or equal to 419,430. Compute 2^19=524,288. 2^18=262,144. 419,430 > 262,144, less than 524,288. So leading bit at position 18 (0-index)? Actually power 2^19 is greater, so highest power less than N is 2^18. So number of bits needed = 19 (since count from 0 to 18 inclusive). Because if number is between 2^18 and 2^19-1 inclusive, it needs 19 bits. So answer: 19 bits.",
