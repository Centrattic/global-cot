But leading zeros can be omitted. The most significant hex digit is 6 (binary 0110). So first hex digit gives 3 bits? Actually 6 in hex = binary 0110. So leading 0 can be omitted. So we have 4 bits from that hex digit? Actually 6 hex = binary 0110, which has length 4 but leading zero omitted gives 3 bits? Wait: 6 hex is 6 decimal. Binary representation is 110. That's 3 bits. So the first hex digit contributes 3 bits, then each subsequent hex digit adds 4 bits. So total bits = 3 + 4*4 = 3 + 16 = 19. Thus answer 19.",
