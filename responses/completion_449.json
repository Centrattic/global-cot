  "cot_content": "We need to convert hex 66666 (in base 16) to binary and count bits. We can think of hex digits: '6' in hex is 110 in binary (since 6 = 0110). So hex digits: 6,6,6,6,6 each 4 bits. So 5 hex digits => 5*4=20 bits. But leading zeros may be omitted. The most significant hex digit is 6 which is binary 0110. The leading zero can be omitted. So first hex digit 6 -> binary '110' (3 bits). Then each subsequent 6 gives 4 bits. So total bits = 3 + 4*4 = 3 + 16 = 19 bits. Alternatively compute value: hex 66666 = 6*16^4+6*16^3+6*16^2+6*16+6 = 6*(65536+4096+256+16+1) =6*69905=419430? Wait 69905*6=419430. Indeed 16^4=65536. Sum inside: 65536+4096=69632, +256=69888, +16=69904, +1=69905. Times 6=419430. That's 419430 decimal. Binary of 419430 is? 419430=2^19? 2^18=262144, 2^19=524288. So it's less than 2^19, greater than 2^18. So highest bit position 18 (0-index). So requires 19 bits. So answer: 19.",
