  "cot_content": "We need to convert hex number 66666 (hex) to binary length. 66666 hex digits: each hex digit 4 bits, 5 digits => 20 bits. But need to account leading zeros? The hex number 66666 has leading digit 6 non-zero so no leading zero. So binary digits = 5*4 =20. Check if most significant hex digit 6 => binary 0110? Actually hex 6=0110 (4 bits). That includes leading zero bit? 0110 has 4 bits but the leading zero may be considered not significant? Usually representation uses minimal bits, but we can drop leading zero. So hex 6 uses 3 bits (110). So overall bits maybe 19? Let's compute: 6=110 (3 bits), followed by 6=110, 6=110, 6=110, 6=110. So 5*3=15? Wait but adjacency? Actually each hex digit after the first can be represented with 4 bits. But if we don't include leading zero of first digit, we reduce by 1? For 6: binary 110 (3 bits). So overall bits = 3 + 4*4 =3+16=19. So answer 19.",
