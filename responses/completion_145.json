Compute: 16^0=1, 16^1=16, 16^2=256, 16^3=4096, 16^4=65536. So value =6*(65536+4096+256+16+1)=6*(65536+4096+256+16+1)=6*(65536+4096=69632; 69632+256=69888; +16=69904; +1=69905). So sum=69905. Then times 6: 69905*6 = 419430? Wait compute: 69905*6 = 419430? Let's compute: 69905*6 = 69905*3*2 = 209715*2 = 419430. Yes, exactly 419430. Interesting. That's 2^something? 2^19=524288, 2^18=262144. 419430 between 2^18 and 2^19. So value is 419430 decimal.\n\nNow we need to write in binary and count digits. We could find highest power of 2 less than or equal to 419430. 2^19=524288 > 419430. 2^18=262144 <= 419430. So the binary representation has 19 digits? Wait binary representation length is floor(log2(n))+1. For n=419430, log2= ~18.7? Actually 2^18=262144, 2^19=524288. So n between these. So floor(log2(n))=18. So length = 18+1=19 bits. But also need check if leading bit is 1 at position 18. Yes.\n\nThus answer: 19 bits.",
