  "cot_content": "We need to convert hex number 66666 (hex) to binary length. In hex, each digit is 4 bits. Number has 5 hex digits. So binary length = 5*4 =20 bits, but leading zeros may be omitted. Highest hex digit is '6' which in binary is 0110. So most significant bits: 0110... So the leading bit 0 can be omitted, so length less than 20: first hex digit '6' = 0110. The most significant bit is 0, so leading bit 0 not counted. So we have bits: 0110 for first hex digit, but leading zero omitted, so first non-zero bit is at position 2 of that 4 bits? Let's compute: 6 in binary: 0110. So the number begins with '0110', but leading zero can be omitted, so first bit is 1 at position 2? Specifically 0110 => bits: 0,1,1,0. Leading zero omitted, then bits: 1,1,0. That's 3 bits for first hex digit. So total bits = 3 + 4*(remaining 4 hex digits) = 3 + 16 = 19 bits. So answer: 19 bits.",
