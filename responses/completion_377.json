So number value = sum 6*16^4 +6*16^3+6*16^2+6*16+6. Compute. 16^0=1. 16^1=16. 16^2=256. 16^3=4096. 16^4=65536. So value = 6*65536 +6*4096 +6*256 +6*16 +6*1 = 393216+24576+1536+96+6 = 393216+24576=417792. 417792+1536=419328. +96=419424. +6=419430. So value=419430. Now find number of bits in binary representation of 419430. Compute log2. 2^18=262144. 2^19=524288. So 419430 between them. So need 19 bits? Actually highest power less than value is 2^18=262144. 2^19=524288 > value. So representation will have 19 bits? Because need represent up to 2^19-1. The number 419430 < 524288, so it requires 19 bits? Because the highest set bit is 2^18 (since 2^18 <= 419430 < 2^19). The index of that bit is 18 (0-index). So number of bits needed is 19. Thus answer 19.",
