But leading zero bits? We need to check if the highest hex digit is 6, which in binary is 0110. So the most significant hex digit '6' has binary 0110, first bit 0 maybe leading zeros omitted. So the actual number of bits would be 4*5=20, but leading zero may be omitted. The representation will have leading zeros omitted, so highest bit will be at position 3 in the most significant hex digit (since 6 binary 0110). So the highest non-zero bit is position 3 (counting from 0). That means we need 4 bits for that digit? Actually 6=110 in 3 bits? Wait 6 in binary is 110. In 4 bits representation 0110. Highest set bit position is 2 (0-index). So total bits = (5-1)*4 + (3+1) = 4*4 + 4? Let's compute: The first 4 hex digits (starting from left) each contribute 4 bits. For the most significant digit 6, its binary is 0110. The leading zero can be omitted, so we only need 3 bits for that digit. But the next digits are 6 again, each 4 bits. So total bits = 3 + 4*4 = 3 + 16 = 19. Wait check: first digit: 0110, leading zero omitted -> 110 (3 bits). Then 6 others: for each subsequent digit, full 4 bits. So total 3 + 4*4 = 19. So answer: 19 bits.",
