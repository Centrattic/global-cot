But leading zeros? The hex number starts with 6, not zero, so highest hex digit is 6, which is binary 0110. The most significant hex digit 6 corresponds to binary 0110. So the most significant bit is 0 in that nibble. So the first 4 bits have leading zero. So effectively the binary representation might have fewer than 20 bits. Let's compute value: 0x66666.\n\nCompute decimal? 0x6 = 6, so 0x66666 = 6*16^4 +6*16^3+6*16^2+6*16+6. 16^0=1.\n\n16^4=65536, times6=393216\n16^3=4096*6=24576\n16^2=256*6=1536\n16^1=16*6=96\n1*6=6\n\nSum:393216+24576=417792\n+1536=419328\n+96=419424\n+6=419430\n\nSo decimal 419430. Now find binary length. Since 419430 = 2^19 -2? Let's check: 2^19=524288. 2^18=262144. 419430 between. 2^19-? 524288-419430=104858. So not power of two. Determine highest power of 2 less than 419430: 2^18=262144, 2^19=524288 too high. So highest power less is 2^18. So binary length = 19 bits (positions 0 to 18). Because 2^18 <= value <2^19. So representation uses 19 bits. Therefore answer 19.",
