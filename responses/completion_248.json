But leading digit 6 (binary 0110). So the most significant bits start with 0110, giving leading zeros? Actually 6 hex = 0110, so first hex digit 6 has leading zero. So the binary representation may have leading zero that can be omitted. So total bits maybe 20-1=19? Let's compute: hex 6 = binary 0110, but leading zero can be omitted unless it's the most significant. In representation, we usually drop leading zeros. So the most significant hex digit 6 gives binary 110? Wait 6 in hex is 0110, but leading zero omitted gives 110. That's 3 bits. So total bits = 3 + (4*4) = 3+16 =19. So answer 19.",
