So value =6*(65536+4096+256+16+1) =6*(700? Let's sum: 65536+4096=69632, plus 256=69888, plus16=69904, plus1=69905. So 6*69905= 6*69905= 419430? Wait compute: 69905*6: 69905*2=139810, times3=419430? Let's compute precisely: 69905*6 = 69905*5 +69905 = 349525 + 69905 = 419430. Yes value=419430 decimal. Now need number of bits in binary representation. Find highest power of 2 <=419430. 2^19=524288 too high. 2^18=262144. 2^19 is 524k so too high. So highest power <=419430 is 2^18=262144. Next 2^19 too high. So binary representation will have 19 bits? Since 2^18 is 1 at position 18 (counting from 0). Number of bits is floor(log2(419430))+1. log2(419430) is between 18 and 19. floor is 18, +1 =19 bits. So answer: 19.",
