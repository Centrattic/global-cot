But leading digit 6 is non-zero. So binary representation may use up to 20 bits. But some leading bits may be zero? Actually hex digit 6 is 0110. So the most significant nibble is 0110. That's 4 bits, but leading bit is 0. So the most significant bit is 0? Wait, the most significant hex digit is 6 which is binary 0110. The leading bit of the whole number is 0, so the number may need fewer than 20 bits. For hex number 66666, the first (most significant) digit is 6, binary 0110, but the leading zero is not counted as a bit. So we have 4 bits for first digit but the first bit is zero; so effectively we have 3 significant bits from that nibble, but the most significant bit of the entire number is the second bit of that nibble (since first is zero). So effective bit length: we can compute numeric value: 6*16^4 + 6*16^3 + 6*16^2 + 6*16 + 6. Let's compute: 16^1=16, 16^2=256, 16^3=4096, 16^4=65536. So value = 6*65536 + 6*4096 + 6*256 + 6*16 + 6 = 393216 + 24576 + 1536 + 96 + 6 = 393216+24576=417792; +1536=419328; +96=419424; +6=419430. So value = 419430. Binary length? Find highest power of 2 <= 419430. 2^19 = 524,288. 2^18 = 262,144. So 419430 between 2^18 and 2^19. So the most significant bit is at position 18 (0-indexed). So number of bits = 19. Because bits positions 0..18 inclusive = 19 bits. So answer 19.",
