So total bits = 5*4=20 bits. However leading zeros may be omitted. The most significant hex digit is 6 (0110). So the highest bit is 0 in that nibble? Actually 6 decimal is 0110 binary. The leading bit is 0? Wait 6 in hex is 0110 (4 bits). The leading bit is 0? But the most significant bit of the whole number is the top bit of the most significant 4-bit group. Since it's 0110, the topmost bit is 0, so the number uses only 3 bits from that group? For the first nibble, if it's 0110, the leading bit 0 can be omitted. So the number of bits will be less than 20. Let's compute binary representation.\n\nHex 6 = binary 0110. So 0x66666 = hex digits: 6 6 6 6 6. So full binary: 0110 0110 0110 0110 0110. That's 20 bits. But leading zero can be trimmed: the first bit is 0; so effective bits = 19? Let's examine: The first nibble is 0110. Highest set bit in that nibble is the second bit (from left). So bits: positions from left: bit19=0, bit18=1, bit17=1, bit16=0. So highest set bit is at bit18 (0-index?). So number of bits = 18? Wait counting from 0 indexing: if bits from 0 to 19 inclusive, high bit is at position 18? Actually if we have 20 bits positions 19 down to 0. The leading zero means the highest set bit is at position 18. So number of bits = 19? Because bits 0 to 18 inclusive => 19 bits. So answer 19.",
