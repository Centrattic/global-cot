  "cot_content": "We need to find the number of bits in binary representation of the hexadecimal number 66666. That is hex string \"66666\". In hex, each digit is 4 bits. So length = 5*4 = 20 bits. But leading zeros? The most significant hex digit is '6' which is binary 0110, but leading zero omitted. So first hex digit '6' corresponds to binary 110? Actually 6 hex = decimal 6. Binary: 0110. But leading zero omitted gives 110. So that's 3 bits. So total bits: first digit 3 bits + remaining 4 digits each 4 bits = 3 + 4*4 = 3+16=19. But check if any zeros at end? The hex digits: 6 6 6 6 6. So binary representation: each 6 is 0110 but the first has leading zero omitted. So first 6 gives 110. Subsequent 6 give 0110 each. So total bits = 3 + 4*4 = 19. So answer 19.",
