For hex digit 6 (binary 0110). Each digit has 4 bits. So 5 digits => 20 bits. However, leading zero bits can be omitted. The most significant hex digit is 6, binary 0110. The leading zero can be omitted. So first digit: 6 => 110. Wait 6 in binary: 6 decimal = 110 binary (3 bits). So first hex digit contributes 3 bits. The remaining 4 hex digits each contribute full 4 bits. So total bits: 3 + 4*4 = 3 + 16 = 19 bits. So answer: 19.",
