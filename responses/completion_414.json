  "cot_content": "We need to determine representation of hex number 66666 (hex) in binary. 66666 hex = hex digits: 6 6 6 6 6. Each hex digit 4 bits. So total bits: 5*4=20 bits. But leading zeros may be omitted, but the most significant hex digit is 6 (binary 0110). So leading bit is 0? Actually 6 hex is 0110 binary (4 bits). The leading bit is 0; but we consider bits needed to represent the number without leading zeros. Since first digit 6's binary is 0110, but leading zero can be omitted, so we have 3 bits for that digit. So total bits: first digit 3 bits, plus 4*4=16 bits for remaining four digits = 19 bits. Also check if the value is divisible by powers of 2? But 6 hex ends with 6 decimal? Anyway result likely 19 bits. But consider hex 66666 hex = 0x66666. Binary length? Compute value: 0x66666 = (6*16^4)+(6*16^3)+(6*16^2)+(6*16)+(6). 16^4=65536. So 6*65536=393216. 16^3=4096*6=24576. 16^2=256*6=1536. 16*6=96. +6. Sum:393216+24576=417792; +1536=419328; +96=419424; +6=419430. So value=419430 decimal. Now binary of 419430? 419430=2^19-2? Let's check: 2^19=524288. 524288-419430=104858. Not helpful. Let's find binary length: highest power of 2 <=419430. 2^18=262144; 2^19=524288 >419430. So need 19 bits. The leading bit is 1 at position 18. So 19 bits. So answer: 19.",
