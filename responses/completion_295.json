  "cot_content": "We need to compute binary length of hex number 66666 (hex). First, interpret 66666 hex as integer. Let's compute.\n\nHex digits: 6 6 6 6 6. Each hex digit corresponds to 4 bits. So 5 hex digits => at most 20 bits. But leading digit 6 is non-zero so bits = 4*5 = 20? Wait but maybe leading hex digit 6 leads to binary representation starting with something less than 8? Hex 6 is binary 0110. So first hex digit 6 corresponds to 4 bits but leading bit 0 may drop? For leading hex digit 6, binary is 110. Actually hex 6 = decimal 6, binary 110. That's 3 bits. So total bits = 3 + 4*4 = 3+16=19? But need to check if any leading zero dropped: hex digit 6 is 0110, but the leading zero could be omitted. So we have 19 bits. Let's confirm: hex 66666 = 0x66666. In decimal? compute: 6*16^4 + 6*16^3 +6*16^2+6*16+6. 16^4=65536. So 6*65536=393216. 16^3=4096, 6*4096=24576. 16^2=256, 6*256=1536. 16^1=16, 6*16=96. plus 6=6. Sum: 393216+24576=417792. +1536=419328. +96=419424. +6=419430. So integer 419,430. Binary length: floor(log2(419430))+1. log2(419430). 2^19=524,288. 2^18=262,144. 419,430 between 262,144 and 524,288. So highest power less than equal is 2^18=262,144. So need 19 bits. So answer 19.",
