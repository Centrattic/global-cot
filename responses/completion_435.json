  "cot_content": "We need to find number of bits in binary representation of hex number 66666 (base-16). Interpret 66666 (hex) as a hexadecimal number 0x66666. Compute its decimal value? We can convert hex to binary. Each hex digit is 4 bits. If the most significant hex digit is non-zero, number of bits = (#hex digits *4) minus leading zeros. But need to check if the most significant hex digit's highest bit may be zero. The hex digits: 6 6 6 6 6. Each hex digit is 0110. So the binary string would be 0110 0110 0110 0110 0110. That's 5 digits *4=20 bits. But the leading 0 bit can be omitted. The first hex digit is 6, which in binary is 0110. So the most significant bit is 0, so we can drop it. So we have 3 bits from the first digit? Actually 6 (0110) has only bits at positions 4-1? 0110 is bits: 0*8 +1*4+1*2+0*1 = 6. So the leading zero bit makes the most significant bit 0. So the total significant bits: 4*5-1=19 bits. Wait, but we need to check if any leading zeros beyond first hex digit? The first hex digit 6 has leading zero in its 4-bit group. So the binary representation would start with 1? Actually 0110 -> leading zero then 110. So the first non-zero bit is the one corresponding to 4's place. So the first '1' is in the second bit from left. So the length of binary representation is 4*5-1=19 bits. Let's verify: 6 hex -> 0110. So the binary string: 0110 0110 0110 0110 0110. That's 20 bits. Dropping leading 0 gives 19 bits. So answer: 19.",
