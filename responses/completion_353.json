So number = 6*16^4 + 6*16^3 + 6*16^2 + 6*16^1 + 6*16^0.\n\nCompute: 16^0=1; 16^1=16; 16^2=256; 16^3=4096; 16^4=65536.\n\nSum: 6*65536=393216; 6*4096=24576; 6*256=1536; 6*16=96; 6*1=6. Total=393216+24576=417792; +1536=419328; +96=419424; +6=419430.\n\nSo decimal value 419,430. Now need binary representation length (number of bits). The number of bits needed is floor(log2(419430))+1. Compute log2: 2^19=524,288; 2^18=262,144; 2^19>419k>2^18. So between 18 and 19 bits. 419,430 is less than 2^19. Need to check if 2^18=262,144; 2^19=524,288. So 419,430 > 262,144. So bits needed 19? Wait bits count: if number <2^n then need n bits. For number nbits: minimal k such that 2^(k-1) <= n < 2^k. Actually if n=419430, 2^18=262144 <= n < 2^19=524288. So need 19 bits? Because representation uses bits positions 0 to 18 inclusive? For 419430, the highest power of 2 less than or equal to it is 2^18=262,144. So its binary representation will have a 1 in position 18 (0-index). So total bits = 19 (positions 0 through 18). So answer: 19 bits.",
