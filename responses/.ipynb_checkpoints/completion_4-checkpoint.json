But leading zeros may be omitted. Highest hex digit is 6 which is 0110, so first hex digit '6' leading bits 0110, but leading zeros can be omitted so actual number of bits =? The most significant hex digit 6 corresponds to bits 0110. So the leading zero can be omitted, leaving 4 bits? Actually 6 in binary 0110 (4 bits). Leading zero can be omitted, so we have 4 bits. So total bits = 4 + 4*4 =4+16=20? Wait we had 5 digits: first digit 6, next 6,6,6,6. So 5 hex digits each 4 bits =20 bits. But leading zeros removed: first digit 6 is 0110, leading zero removed leaves 110? Actually 6 in hex is 0110 binary. The most significant bit is 0, so we can omit that leading zero. So first digit contributes 3 bits. So total bits=3 + 4*4 =3+16=19 bits. So answer 19.",
