  "cot_content": "We need to convert hex number 66666 (base16) to binary length. Hex digits: each hex digit = 4 bits. The hex number is 5 digits: 6 6 6 6 6. Each hex digit 6 = in binary '0110'. For 5 hex digits, total bits = 5*4=20 bits. However leading zeros may be omitted. Highest hex digit 6 is nonzero, so full 20 bits? But the most significant hex digit 6 corresponds to binary 0110, leading zero might be omitted in representation, reducing bits by 1? Actually representation usually doesn't include leading zeros. For hex '6' leading digit, binary would be '110' (without leading zero). So the first hex digit 6 in binary 0110, drop leading zero gives 3 bits. The other 4 hex digits each produce 4 bits. So total bits = 3 + 4*4 = 3+16=19 bits. So answer 19. Let's double-check: hex 66666: in hex to binary: 6=0110. So number: 0110 0110 0110 0110 0110. Drop leading zero: 1100110011001100110 (but check grouping). Let's convert: 6=0110. So sequence: 0110 0110 0110 0110 0110. That's 20 bits, but first leading zero can drop -> 19 bits. So answer 19.",
