  "cot_content": "We need to find number of bits of hex number 66666 (hex). That is hex digits: 6 6 6 6 6. That is 5 hex digits. Each hex digit is 4 bits. So total bits = 5*4 =20 bits. But leading zeros may be omitted; but number could start with 6 (non-zero). So 20 bits. But check: 6 in hex is binary 0110. So each hex digit gives 4 bits. So 5*4 =20 bits. Confirm no leading zeros: the highest hex digit 6, so first bits: 0110. So leading bit is 0? Actually the first nibble 6 is 0110. The leading bit is 0 so the most significant bit is 0? Wait if we write 6 as 0110, the leading bit is 0. But we don't count leading zeros. So the number is 0b0110 0110 ... but leading zero not counted. So the first nibble is 0110; the first bit is 0. So effectively the number of bits needed is 19? Let's compute value: hex 66666 = 0x66666. Compute decimal? We can compute binary representation: each hex digit 6 => 0110. So sequence: 0110 0110 0110 0110 0110. That's 20 bits but first bit is 0. So we could drop that leading zero: effectively 19 bits. But is that correct? Let's check: the first hex digit is 6, which in binary is 0110. The leading zero could be omitted, leaving 19 bits: 110 0110 0110 0110 0110. But does dropping that leading zero change value? Yes, because we drop leading zero bit. So the number will have 19 bits. Because the most significant bit is 1 at position 18 (0-indexed). So answer: 19 bits.",
