But check leading zeros: hex digit 6 is binary 0110. So each 4 bits. So total bits = 5*4 = 20. Need to confirm if any leading zeros trimmed? The leading digit is 6 => binary 0110, most significant bit is 0; but leading zero may be omitted. So actual binary representation starts with 0, so first bit is 0. Binary length would be 20 bits but leading zero would be omitted, reducing to 19? Let's compute: 6 in hex is decimal 6. Highest power of 2: 6*16^4 +... But 6*16^4 = 6*65536 = 393216. That's the highest place. The binary of 393216 is? 393216 = 2^? 2^18 = 262144, 2^19=524288 too high. So 393216 < 524288. So the highest set bit is at 2^18? 2^18=262144. Let's check 393216-262144=131072, which is 2^17. So we have bits at positions 18 and 17 set. So representation length 19 bits (index 18). So indeed leading zero omitted. Therefore answer 19.
