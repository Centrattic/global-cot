Let's compute decimal: each hex digit 6. Number of hex digits 5. So hex = 6*16^4 + 6*16^3 + 6*16^2 + 6*16 + 6.\n\nCompute: 16^0=1, 16^1=16, 16^2=256, 16^3=4096, 16^4=65536.\n\nSo value = 6*(65536+4096+256+16+1) = 6*(700+?? Wait sum: 65536+4096=69632; +256=69888; +16=69904; +1=69905. So sum=69905. times 6 = 419430. Actually 69905*6 = 419430. Yes.\n\nSo decimal value 419430. Now find binary length. Need number of bits needed to represent 419430.\n\nCompute highest power of 2 <= 419430. 2^19=524288 >, 2^18=262144 <, 2^19 too high. So need bits up to 18? Actually 2^18=262144, 2^19=524288. So 419430 between them. So highest power of 2 is 2^18=262144. So binary representation has 19 bits? Because bits start from 0 to 18 inclusive: that's 19 bits. But we need to confirm if leading bit is 1? Since 419430 < 2^19, highest bit is 2^18. So representation uses bits indices 0..18 inclusive: that's 19 bits. So answer: 19 bits. But check calculation: 419430 in binary? 419430 = 2^18 + 2^17 + ...? Let's quickly compute: 2^19=524288. Subtract 419430: 524288-419430=104858. So 419430 = 524288 - 104858. Not helpful.\n\nLet's just output 19.",
