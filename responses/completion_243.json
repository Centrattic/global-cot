  "cot_content": "We need to find the number of bits in binary representation of decimal value of hex 66666. Hex digits: each hex digit is 4 bits. 5 digits -> up to 20 bits. But leading digit is 6, which is 0110 in binary, not zero. So 4*5=20 bits. But need to check if highest bit is 1? 6 hex digit has binary 0110, leading bit 0? Actually hex 6 is 0110, leading zero bit is not counted. For number 0x66666: binary pattern: 6=0110. So the most significant bit is 0, so effectively the number is less than 2^19? Let's compute value: 6*16^4 + 6*16^3 + 6*16^2 + 6*16 + 6. 16^4=65536, so 6*65536=393216. 16^3=4096 => 6*4096=24576. 16^2=256 => 1536. 16=16 =>96. +6 =>6. Sum: 393216+24576=417792; +1536=419328; +96=419424; +6=419430. So decimal 419,430. Binary length? 2^18=262,144; 2^19=524,288. So between 2^18 and 2^19, so needs 19 bits? Wait highest power less than number: 2^18=262,144, 2^19=524,288. The number is 419,430 < 524,288, > 262,144, so need 19 bits (since 2^18 is 262,144, which uses 19th bit? Actually bit positions start at 0 for 1. The number less than 2^19, greater equal 2^18, so binary representation length is 19 bits (since highest set bit index 18). So answer: 19 bits.",
