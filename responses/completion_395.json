But leading zeros not counted. So if hex representation has leading zeros? 66666 hex has 5 hex digits? Actually it's 5 hex digits: 6,6,6,6,6. So hex digits count=5. For each hex digit, up to 4 bits. But the most significant hex digit is '6', which in binary is 0110 (4 bits). But leading zero might be omitted, so the number of bits is 4*5- leading zeros? But the first hex digit 6 is binary 0110 (4 bits). But the most significant bit is 1 (the second bit from left). So the first hex digit contributes 3 bits? Actually 6=110 in binary (3 bits). Because leading zero can be omitted. So first digit 6 requires 3 bits. The remaining 4 digits each add 4 bits. Total bits = 3 + 4*4 = 3+16=19 bits. Thus answer 19.",
