  "cot_content": "We need to convert hex number 66666 (base 16) to binary. Each hex digit corresponds to 4 binary bits. Number has 5 hex digits: '6','6','6','6','6'. So total bits = 5*4=20. But leading zeros may be dropped. Hex digit 6 is binary 0110. The highest digit is 6, which is >0, so first hex digit is non-zero, so no leading zeros. So 20 bits. But we need count of bits when representing in binary. Since 6 is non-zero, the highest bit is 1? Wait 6 hex = 0110 binary, leading zero in that nibble. But the highest nibble still contributes up to 4 bits, but the leading bit of the highest nibble might be zero. Let's analyze: hex 6 = decimal 6 = binary 110. Actually 6 decimal = 110 binary (3 bits). But hex 6 as a digit is 0110. When we combine 5 digits, the most significant nibble is 6, giving binary leading bits 0110. So the overall binary representation would start with 0110..., but we typically drop leading zeros. So the most significant bit may be 1 at position 3 (from left). So total bits = 20-1=19? Let's check: hex 6 (decimal 6) = binary 110. That's 3 bits. So the leading nibble contributes 3 bits, not 4. So the total bits = 3 + (4*4)=3+16=19. But need to confirm: representation of 0x66666 = 0b 0110 0110 0110 0110 0110. Dropping leading zero results in 19 bits: 110 0110 0110 0110 0110 0110? Wait count: 5 nibbles = 20 bits, but first nibble has leading zero. So number of bits = 20-1=19. So answer 19.",
