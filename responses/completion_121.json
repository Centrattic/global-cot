  "cot_content": "We need to convert hex 66666 (in base-16), to binary length. 66666 hex is digits: '6','6','6','6','6' each hex digit 4 bits. So 5 hex digits => 5*4=20 bits. But leading digit '6' non-zero so 20 bits. However maybe some leading zeros in binary representation? Since hex '6' corresponds binary 0110, but most significant bit is 0? Actually '6' hex = 0110 (4 bits). The most significant hex digit is 6, which binary 0110, highest bit 0? Actually 6 decimal is 110 binary 3 bits. Represented as 0110 4 bits. So the leading zero bit might not be significant, so the actual length may be 19 bits? Let's check: hex 6 = decimal 6 = binary 110 (3 bits). So the 4-bit representation 0110 has leading zero that can be omitted. So total bits: 4*5=20 but minus one leading zero = 19 bits. But need to confirm if the most significant bit could be omitted. The first hex digit '6' has binary 0110; leading zero can be omitted, so we have 3 bits for that digit. So total bits = 3 + (4*4) =3 + 16 =19. So answer 19.",
