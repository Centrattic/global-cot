  "cot_content": "We need to convert hex number 66666 (hexadecimal) to base 2 length. In hex, each digit corresponds to 4 bits. So the number is 5 hex digits. But leading hex digit could be zero? 6 is non-zero. So number of bits = 5 * 4 = 20. But check if leading digit is 6, which in binary is 0110. So the first bit can be zero? But we count bits without leading zeros. The first hex digit 6 is binary 0110. Leading zero can be omitted. So the most significant bit is 0? Actually 6 hex = 0110 in 4 bits. The leading bit of that 4-bit group is 0, but we don't count that as a bit since we only count significant bits. The first hex digit '6' representation in binary is 110 (3 bits). Because 6 decimal is binary 110. So the first hex digit gives 3 bits. Then the remaining 4 hex digits each give 4 bits. So total bits = 3 + 4*4 = 3 + 16 = 19 bits. So answer 19.",
