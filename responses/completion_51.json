That's 5 digits. Value = 6*(16^4)+6*(16^3)+6*(16^2)+6*(16^1)+6*(16^0). Compute: 16^0=1; 16^1=16; 16^2=256; 16^3=4096; 16^4=65536. Multiply by 6: 6*65536=393216; 6*4096=24576; 6*256=1536; 6*16=96; 6*1=6. Sum: 393216+24576=417792; +1536=419328; +96=419424; +6=419430. So decimal value is 419430.\n\nWe need number of bits in binary representation of 419430. Find highest power of 2 <= value: 2^19=524,288; too high. 2^18=262,144. 2^19 bigger. Actually 2^18=262,144; 2^19=524,288. So 419,430 is between. So need 19 bits? Let's check: Highest bit position is 18 (0-index). The number is less than 2^19 but greater than 2^18. So it needs 19 bits to represent (since highest bit is at position 18, so bits from 0 to 18 inclusive = 19 bits). Wait check: If number < 2^19, the binary length is floor(log2(n))+1. log2(419430) \u2248? 2^18=262,144; 2^19=524,288. Since 419430 <524,288 >262,144. So floor(log2(n)) = 18. So length = 18+1=19 bits.\n\nThus answer: 19.",
