But leading zeros may be omitted. Hex digits: 6 6 6 6 6. In binary each hex digit 6 -> 0110. So full 20-bit string: 0110 0110 0110 0110 0110. The leading zero of first digit maybe leading zero but still part of representation? Typically when writing number in base 2, we don't include leading zeros unless necessary. So first hex digit 6 is binary 0110. The leading zero can be omitted, so first nibble becomes 110. Then total bits: 3+4+4+4+4 = 19 bits. So answer: 19.",
