Each hex digit is 4 bits => 5*4=20 bits. But leading zeros may occur? The most significant digit is 6, which is binary 0110. So the first hex digit '6' is 0110 -> leading zero may be omitted? For counting bits, we consider the representation without leading zeros. 6 in hex is 0110, but the leading zero can be omitted because it's not significant. So the first hex digit 6 corresponds to binary 110, 3 bits. Wait: hex digit 6 is binary 0110, but leading zero can be omitted. So representation length = 3 + (4*4)=3+16=19 bits? Let's compute: 6 in hex = decimal 6. Binary: 110. So first hex digit gives 3 bits. Next four hex digits '6' each give 4 bits. So total 3+16=19 bits. So answer 19.",
