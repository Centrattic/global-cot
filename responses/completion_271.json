Each hex digit corresponds to 4 bits. Five digits => 20 bits max. But leading digit is 6 (binary 0110). Highest hex value 6 = binary 0110. Since leading hex digit is 6, which is binary 0110. The most significant bit is 0, but leading zeros may be omitted; we want number of bits needed to represent the number. Since first hex digit 6 has binary pattern 0110, the most significant bit is 0. But we don't include leading zeros. So we need to find the position of highest 1 bit.\n\nCompute value: 6*16^4+6*16^3+6*16^2+6*16+6.\n\n16^1=16,16^2=256,16^3=4096,16^4=65536.\n\nCompute: 6*65536=393216; 6*4096=24576; 6*256=1536; 6*16=96; +6=6.\n\nSum: 393216+24576=417792; +1536=419328; +96=419424; +6=419430.\n\nSo decimal value 419430.\n\nNow find binary representation length. Compute powers of two: 2^19=524288, too high. 2^18=262144. 2^19=524288 > 419430. So highest power <= value is 2^18=262144. So we need at least 19 bits? Actually bits count = floor(log2(n))+1. Since 419430 < 2^19, and > 2^18, log2 ~18.7. So floor=18, +1 => 19 bits. So answer 19. Let's double-check: value 419430 = 2^19 - 86? Actually 2^19=524288, difference 104858. So indeed 19 bits.\n\nThus answer: 19.",
