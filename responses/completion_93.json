But check leading zeros? The most significant hex digit is 6, which in binary is 0110. So leading bit is 0? But we don't count leading zeros. The first hex digit 6 is binary 0110. The leading bit is 0, but we don't count leading zeros. So the first significant bit is the second bit of that 4-bit group. So the number of bits =? For hex digit 6: binary 0110 => bits needed = 3 (since leading zero omitted). So total bits = 3 + (4*(4)) = 3+16=19? Wait. 5 hex digits: first digit 6 => 0110, so 3 bits. The remaining 4 digits each 4 bits fully: 4*4=16. Total 19 bits. So answer: 19.",
