Each hex digit corresponds to 4 binary bits. So total bits = 5*4 = 20 bits. But leading zeros may be omitted: the most significant hex digit is 6, which is binary 0110. Since it's 6 (not zero), the leading bit (most significant bit) is 0? Wait 6 hex = binary 0110. So the most significant hex digit is 6, not zero. So the binary representation will have 20 bits, but the leading bit could be 0? But we don't count leading zeros. 6 hex digit has binary representation 0110, but you can drop leading zero. So 6 hex is 110 binary (3 bits). But if we treat whole number, hex digits: 6 6 6 6 6. Each hex digit except the first might have leading zeros. But we need total number of binary digits in the minimal representation. For hex digit 6 -> binary 110 (3 bits). Next 4 hex digits each 6 again. So we might have 3 + 4*4? Wait let's compute.\n\nNumber hex: 6 6 6 6 6. Write each hex digit to binary: 6 = 0110. So each digit gives 4 bits but leading zero can drop for first digit. For first digit, we drop leading zero, leaving 3 bits. For subsequent digits, we keep all 4 bits because they are in middle. So total bits = 3 + 4*4 = 3 + 16 = 19 bits. But check: The second digit is 6, but if we drop leading zero from its binary representation? The first digit's leading zero is dropped, but subsequent digits all need full 4 bits because they are not leading. So total bits = 3 + 4*4 = 19. So answer 19.",
