Value in hex: digits: 6*16^4 + 6*16^3 + 6*16^2 + 6*16 + 6. Compute. 16^4=65536. 16^3=4096. 16^2=256. 16^1=16. So value =6*65536 +6*4096 +6*256 +6*16 +6. Compute: 6*65536=393216. 6*4096=24576. 6*256=1536. 6*16=96. +6=6. Sum: 393216+24576=417792. +1536=419328. +96=419424. +6=419430. So decimal 419430. Now binary representation length? Binary of 419430. Note 419430 = 2^19 - 2? Let's check powers. 2^18=262,144. 2^19=524,288. So 419,430 is between. Compute difference: 524,288-419,430=104,858. Not helpful. Let's find highest power less than or equal: 2^18=262,144. 2^19=524,288. So the representation uses 19 bits? Actually if number < 2^19 and >= 2^18, then binary length is 19 bits. Because highest bit position 18 (0-index). So need 19 bits. Let's verify: 419,430 / 2^18 = 419,430/262,144 \u2248 1.6. So leading bit 1 at position 18. So 19 bits. Let's double-check maybe it's exactly 2^19 - something? 524,288-419,430=104,858 which is not power of two. So answer 19.",
