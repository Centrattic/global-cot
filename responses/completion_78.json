  "cot_content": "We need to convert hex number 66666 (hex) to binary length. 66666 hex digits: each hex digit is 4 bits. So length = 5*4=20 bits. But check leading zeros: hex 6 is '0110' in 4 bits. So 20 bits. But maybe leading zeros not counted? The most significant bit of first digit may be zero, but we still count all bits? Usually when writing binary representation, leading zeros omitted. For hex digit '6' in most significant position, its binary '110' (3 bits) since leading zero omitted. So first digit '6' = 110. So number of bits = 3 + 4*(4) = 3+16=19? Wait: first digit '6' (binary 0110). Without leading zeros, it's 110 (3 bits). So rest four digits each 4 bits. So total 3+4*4=19. But is there any leading zero in first digit? If most significant digit is 6, its binary representation is 110. So length 3. But check if any leading zeros omitted? Yes. So answer 19.",
