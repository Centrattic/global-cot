  "cot_content": "We need to compute decimal value of hex 66666 (base-16). That's hex digits: 6 6 6 6 6. Each hex digit corresponds to 4 bits. If all digits are 6 (binary 0110). The highest digit is 6 => 100? Actually hex digit 6 => binary 0110. So the entire number has 5 hex digits, so 5*4=20 bits. But leading zeros maybe. The most significant hex digit is 6, which in binary 0110. Leading zero might be omitted. So the binary representation of 0x66666 has bits: first hex digit 6 => binary 0110. The leading zero omitted, leaving 3 bits? Wait: hex digit 6 is binary 0110. The most significant bit among these 4 bits is 0 leading, so the first significant bit is the second bit (1). So the first hex digit contributes 3 significant bits? Actually binary of 6 is 110 in 3 bits (since leading zero omitted). So the number has 3 + (4*4)=3+16=19 bits? Let's verify: 5 hex digits = 20 bits including leading zero. But the leading zero can be omitted, but we still need to count bits until the highest significant bit. The value: hex 0x66666 decimal? Let's compute: 6*16^4 + 6*16^3 + 6*16^2 + 6*16 + 6. 16^4=65536, times6=393216. 16^3=4096*6=24576. 16^2=256*6=1536. 16*6=96. plus6=6. Sum: 393216+24576=417792; +1536=419328; +96=419424; +6=419430. So decimal 419430. Binary? Let's find highest power less than or equal: 2^19=524288 > 419430, 2^18=262144 < 419430. So highest bit position is 18 (0-indexed). So bits from 18 down to 0. So 19 bits. Yes answer 19.",
