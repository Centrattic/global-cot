But leading zeros not counted. Highest hex digit 6 (0110). So first digit 6 in hex has binary 0110. But leading zero can be omitted. So the first hex digit '6' binary is 0110. Leading zero omitted gives 110. So number has 3 bits from first hex digit? Wait: 6 hex = decimal 6. Binary of 6 is 110. That's 3 bits. So total bits: first digit 3 bits + 4*4=16 bits =19 bits? Wait: Each subsequent hex digit has 4 bits, no leading zeros. So total bits = 3 + 4*4 = 3 +16 =19. But check: the first hex digit '6' in binary is 0110. Leading zero omitted gives 110 (3 bits). So yes 19 bits.",
