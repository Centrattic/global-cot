Each hex digit 6 is binary 0110. So the hex number has 5 digits. Each hex digit corresponds to 4 bits. So total bits = 5 * 4 = 20 bits. But leading zeros maybe? The most significant digit is 6, which is binary 0110 (4 bits). So the overall binary representation will be 20 bits. So answer 20.\n\nDouble-check: hex digits: 6 hex = decimal 6. In binary: 0110. So the number is 6*16^4 + 6*16^3 + 6*16^2 + 6*16 + 6. Its value in decimal is 6*(16^4+16^3+...+1). But irrelevant. Just count bits: 5 hex digits = 20 bits.\n\nThus answer: 20.",
