  "cot_content": "We need to convert hex number 66666 (hex) to decimal, then to binary length. 66666 hex = digits: 6 6 6 6 6. In hex, each digit 4 bits. So directly: hex 66666 has 5 hex digits, each 4 bits, so 20 bits. But leading zeros not needed. In hex, the most significant digit is 6 (binary 0110). So the first hex digit gives 4 bits, but leading zeros in that group? The value of most significant digit 6 = 0110, but the leading zero is not counted as significant bit, so effectively 3 bits? Actually number 6 in hex is 6 decimal. In binary it's 110. That's 3 bits. So total bits = 3 + (4*4) = 3 + 16 = 19. Wait but careful: hex 66666 = in hex 6 6 6 6 6. Each hex digit except first can be full 4 bits. The most significant hex digit is 6: binary 0110 (4 bits). But leading zero not counted, so effective bits 3. So total 3 + 4*4 = 3+16=19 bits. So answer 19.",
