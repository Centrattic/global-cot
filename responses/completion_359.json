  "cot_content": "We have hex number 66666 (hex). Convert to binary length. In hex, each hex digit corresponds to 4 bits. So a hex number with n digits has at most 4n bits, but leading zeros may not be used. So number of bits equals 4*n minus leading zeros. For hex 66666: digits: '6','6','6','6','6' = five hex digits. Highest hex digit '6' (binary 0110). So first hex digit is non-zero, so leading zeros not needed. But the first hex digit '6' in binary is 0110, but the first bit is 0; but we don't count leading zeros. So the most significant digit '6' is 0110; the leading one of that is at position corresponding to bit 3? Let's compute: hex digit '6' = decimal 6. In binary: 0110 (4 bits). The most significant bit of that hex digit is 0 (the 8's place). But we don't include leading zeros. So the first 1 appears at bit position 2 of that 4-bit group (counting from 0?). Let's just compute the total bits needed: Since hex digit '6' has top bit 0, the first 1 is at second most significant bit of that group (i.e., bit 2 of 4-bit group). So overall length: we have 5 hex digits, but first digit has only 3 significant bits? Let's map: '6' binary: 0110. The most significant 1 is at bit position 2 (from left: bits 3,2,1,0). So bits: 0 1 1 0. So the most significant 1 is in position 2 (from left). So number of bits = 4*5 - 1 = 19? Wait: 5 hex digits *4 =20 bits. But because the most significant hex digit has leading zero, we subtract 1. So 19 bits. Thus answer: 19.",
