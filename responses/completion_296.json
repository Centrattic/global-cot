So 5 hex digits *4 =20 bits. But leading zeros? The first hex digit is 6, which in binary is 0110, but leading zero may be omitted. So actual bits: 3 bits for first digit? 6 decimal = 110 binary (3 bits). But if we consider full representation without leading zeros, we would have 3+4*4=3+16=19 bits. So answer 19.",
