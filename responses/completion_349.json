But leading zeros may be omitted if leading hex digit may be less than 8? 6 hex digit '6' is binary 0110. So each hex digit gives 4 bits, but if leading hex digit 6 is non-zero, then its binary representation is 0110, but leading zeros inside the digit can be omitted? Actually standard representation includes all bits: For hex number 66666, the most significant digit is '6', which is binary 0110. So the binary representation would start with 0110..., but leading zero may be omitted? Usually we don't include leading zeros. So the first hex digit 6 -> binary 110? Wait 6 decimal = 6= 110 binary (3 bits). But hex digit 6 is 0110 in 4 bits. But leading zero may be omitted unless needed. So the total number of bits could be 3 + 4*4 = 3+16=19 bits. Let's check: hex 6 = binary 110 (no leading zero). So representation is 110 followed by 4 bits per each next hex digit: 6 6 6 6 6: total 1st digit gives 3 bits, subsequent four digits each 4 bits: total 3+4*4=3+16=19 bits. So answer 19.",
