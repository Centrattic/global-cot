Hex digits: 6 6 6 6 6. In hex, each digit is 4 bits. So 5 hex digits = 20 bits. But the leading hex digit is 6 which is binary 0110, but leading zero may be omitted? The most significant bit? Hex 6 is binary 0110 (4 bits). Leading zeros can be omitted. So the first non-zero bit is in the second bit of that 4. So total bits = 1 (for the first non-zero bit) + 3 remaining bits in that nibble? Let's compute: hex 6 = binary 110? Actually 6 hex = decimal 6 which binary 110 (3 bits). But in 4-bit representation, it's 0110. So leading zero can be omitted. So length = 3 bits for first nibble + 4 bits for each of remaining four hex digits = 3 + 4*4 = 3 +16 =19 bits. Wait but check: 5 hex digits, first is 6, value 6 decimal, binary 110. So indeed 3 bits. So answer 19.",
