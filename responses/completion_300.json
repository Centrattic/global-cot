  "cot_content": "We need to convert hexadecimal 66666 (base 16) to decimal? Actually 66666 in hex string: digits \"6 6 6 6 6\". Each hex digit is 4 bits. So 5 hex digits => 5*4=20 bits. But need to consider leading zeros? The most significant digit is 6 (non-zero). So number of bits = 20. But check if leading zeros trimmed: 6 in hex is binary 0110, but leading zero omitted. So the most significant bit of that group is 1? Actually 6 hex is binary 0110. The first digit 6 => binary 0110. Highest bit position is 3 (0-index). So overall bits for 5 digits: positions 0-3,4-7,8-11,12-15,16-19. Highest set bit at position 19? But because first digit is 6, its binary representation 0110 has leading 0. So the top bit of the whole number is bit 18? Let's compute: Hex 66666 = 6*16^4 + 6*16^3 + 6*16^2 + 6*16 + 6. Compute value: 16^4=65536 so 6*65536=393216; 16^3=4096 => 6*4096=24576; 16^2=256 =>6*256=1536; 16*6=96; +6. Sum: 393216+24576=417792; +1536=419328; +96=419424; +6=419430. So decimal 419430. Binary length? 419430 in binary? 419430=2^19-2? Actually 2^19=524288. 2^18=262144. 419430 between. Let's find highest power of two <= 419430: 2^18=262144, 2^19=524288 too high. So highest bit is 18. So number of bits = 19 (bits 0-18). So answer 19. But check: 5 hex digits produce 20 bits but leading zero removed gives 19 bits. So answer 19.",
