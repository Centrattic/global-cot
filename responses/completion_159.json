Convert to decimal? hex 6 6 6 6 6 = 5 digits hex. Each hex digit is 4 bits. So total bits = 5*4 = 20 bits. But leading zeros may drop? The highest hex digit is 6 (binary 0110). For 5 digits, highest is 6 => binary leading bits maybe 0110? The first digit 6 has binary 0110, but since it's the most significant digit, we don't consider leading zero. So the most significant bit is the leading 0 of that 4-bit group? Wait hex digit 6 = 0110 in 4 bits. The leading bit of that group is 0, but the actual most significant bit of the number is the second bit of that group (since the first bit is zero). So the number of bits is less than 20? Let's compute exact value: hex 66666 = 6*16^4 + 6*16^3+6*16^2+6*16+6. Let's compute: 16^4=65536; times 6 = 393216. 16^3=4096; times 6=24576. 16^2=256;*6=1536. 16*6=96. +6. Sum: 393216+24576=417792. +1536=419328. +96=419424. +6=419430. So decimal 419430. Binary of that number? Let's find highest power of 2 less than it: 2^18=262144; 2^19=524288. So it's between 2^18 and 2^19, so needs 19 bits. But leading bit position is 18. So number of bits = 19. Thus answer 19.",
