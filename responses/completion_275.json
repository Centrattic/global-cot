But leading zeros not counted. But need maybe check if highest non-zero bit could be less than 4? For hex digit 6 = binary 0110. So leading digit 6 has binary 0110, but leading zero not counted. So highest bit is 1 at position 2? Actually 0110 = 6 decimal. Binary bits: 0 1 1 0? Wait 6 = 0110. So the most significant bit is at position 2 (starting from 0). That means the length is 4 bits, but the leading zero is omitted, so 3 bits? Wait evaluate. For hex 6: binary representation of 6 is 110 (3 bits). So the first hex digit '6' corresponds to binary 110. So the entire number 66666 hex will have 3 + (4*4)=3+16=19 bits? Let's examine: Each subsequent hex digit contributes 4 bits, but the most significant digit may not use all 4 bits. For hex digit 6, binary is 110 (3 bits). So total bits = 3 + 4*4 = 3+16=19. Let's verify: For hex number 66666, convert to binary: 6=0110 but leading zero omitted. So first hex digit gives 3 bits. Then each of the remaining four hex digits give 4 bits. So total 19 bits. So answer 19.",
