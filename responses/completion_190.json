But leading zeros may be omitted; we need number of bits in binary representation. The most significant hex digit is 6 (binary 0110). So the binary string starts with 0110... So leading zero maybe omitted. So number of bits is 4*5=20, but the leading zero doesn't count? Wait representation of 6 is 0110 but signless. In binary you don't write leading zeros. So the first hex digit 6 corresponds to binary 110? Actually 6 decimal is 110 binary; it's 3 bits. But in hex digit, 6 is 0110 in 4 bits but leading zero omitted gives 110 (3 bits). So total bits: first hex digit 6 gives 3 bits, other 4 hex digits each give 4 bits: total 3 + 4*4 = 3 +16 =19 bits. So answer 19.",
