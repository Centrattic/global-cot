So it would be up to 20 bits. But leading zeros may reduce. The first hex digit is 6 => binary '0110'? Actually 6 hex = 0110 in 4 bits. So highest bit is at position 3 (counting from 0). So the number of bits is 4*5 =20? But need to find most significant 1 bit position. Hex 6= binary 0110. So leading digit 6 has binary 0110, which has leading bit at position 2 (0-index). So overall binary length = 4*5 - leading zeros = 4*5 - 1? Wait: hex 6 has binary 0110, so most significant bit of that group is at position 2 (starting from 0). So overall bits = 4*5 -1 = 20-1=19? Let's compute: 6 hex digits: 0110 0110 0110 0110 0110. This is 20 bits, but first group '0110' has leading zero, so first bit is at position 2 of that group, which shifts overall. So bit length = 20-1 = 19. So answer 19.",
