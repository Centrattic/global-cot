Wait: \"base-16 number 66666\" means a number represented in hexadecimal: digits 6 6 6 6 6. So in hex, that's 0x66666. Convert to decimal? Let's compute. 0x66666 = 6*16^4 + 6*16^3 + 6*16^2 + 6*16 + 6.\n\nCompute powers: 16^0=1, 16^1=16, 16^2=256, 16^3=4096, 16^4=65536.\n\nSo value: 6*65536 = 393216; 6*4096=24576; 6*256=1536; 6*16=96; 6*1=6. Sum: 393216+24576=417792; +1536=419328; +96=419424; +6=419430. So decimal 419430.\n\nNow we need number of bits in binary representation of 419430. Binary length is floor(log2(n))+1.\n\nCompute log2(419430). 2^19 = 524288. 2^18 = 262144. 419430 between 262144 and 524288, so need 19 bits? Wait if n<2^19, need 19 bits. Since 2^19=524288 >419430, so highest power less than n is 2^18=262144. So bits needed = 19 (since highest index 18 +1). So answer 19.\n\nLet's double-check: 419430 in binary? It's 0b1100110000111110110? Not needed.\n\nThus answer: 19.",
