Each hex digit corresponds to 4 bits. So naive: 5*4=20 bits. But leading hex digits may be zero? The first hex digit is 6 (non-zero). So we have exactly 20 bits. But check if the most significant hex digit might not use full 4 bits: 6 in hex is 0110, which has leading 0? Wait 6 in hex is binary 0110 (4 bits). So we have bits: 0110 0110 0110 0110 0110? Actually 5 digits of 6: 6 6 6 6 6. So binary: each 6 is 0110. So the concatenation: 0110 0110 0110 0110 0110. That's 20 bits. So answer 20.",
