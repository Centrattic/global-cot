  "cot_content": "We need to compute 66666 in base-16, then express in binary and count bits. 66666 hex is hex digits: 6 6 6 6 6? Wait \"66666\" as hex string: digits 6,6,6,6,6. That's 5 hex digits, each 4 bits. So number of binary digits is at most 5*4=20. But leading hex digit is 6, which in binary is 0110. So leading bit is 0? Leading zero doesn't count. So first digit 6 in hex is binary 110 (since 6 decimal = 0110, 4 bits but first bit 0). So the most significant bit is 1 (third bit). So we have 4*5=20 bits, but first bit zero -> 19 bits? Wait representation: 6 hex digit = 0110 binary (4 bits). But leading zero can be omitted, so we have 3 bits from that digit: 110. Then next four hex digits each 4 bits: total bits = 3 + 4*4 = 3 + 16 = 19 bits. But need to check if any other leading zeros? none. So answer 19.",
