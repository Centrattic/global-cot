So number of bits is 5*4 =20 bits. But leading zeros are not counted. First digit is 6 -> binary 0110, but leading zero omitted. So bits: first hex digit gives 3 bits? Actually 6 in hex is binary 0110, leading zero can be omitted, so 3 bits. So total bits: 3 + 4*4 =3+16=19? Wait 4 remaining digits each 4 bits. So 4*4=16. Total 19 bits. However need to check if there are any leading zeros beyond? 6 hex is 0110, leading zero omitted, so 3 bits. So answer 19.",
