  "cot_content": "We need to convert hex number 66666 (hex) to binary digits count. First interpret: hex digits: 6 6 6 6 6. Each hex digit is 4 bits. So 5 hex digits -> 20 bits. But check leading zeros may be omitted. Highest digit is 6 (binary 0110). So most significant bits: first hex digit '6' corresponds to 0110 => leading zero bit may be omitted. So number of bits = 5*4 - leading zeros count. The first digit '6' binary: 0110, leading zero can be omitted leaving 3 bits. So total bits = 3 + 4*4? Wait: after first digit 6, we have remaining 4 digits: each 4 bits = 16 bits. So total 3+16=19 bits. But also check if there's any leading zero in second digit? second digit also 6 -> 0110, but since it's not most significant now, we keep all 4 bits. So answer 19 bits.\n\nCheck: hex 66666 = decimal? 6*16^4 + 6*16^3 + 6*16^2 + 6*16 + 6. Compute? 16^4=65536; 6*65536=393216; 16^3=4096; 6*4096=24576; 16^2=256; 6*256=1536; 16: 6*16=96; +6=6. Sum: 393216+24576=417792; +1536=419328; +96=419424; +6=419430. So decimal 419430. Binary of that: need highest power of 2 less than. 419430 decimal = 2^19? 2^19=524288. So less. 2^18=262144. 2^19 too high. So MSB at 2^18. So number of bits = 19? Actually count bits from 0 to 18 inclusive = 19 bits. So answer 19.",
