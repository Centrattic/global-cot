Represent in decimal: 6*16^4 + 6*16^3 + 6*16^2 + 6*16 + 6. Compute: 16^2=256, 16^3=4096, 16^4=65536. So value = 6*(65536+4096+256+16+1). Sum: 65536+4096=69632. +256=69888. +16=69904. +1=69905. Times 6 = 69905*6 = 419430? Wait compute: 69905*6 = 419430? Let's calculate: 69905*6= 69905*3*2? 69905*2=139810; *3=209715; sum 419430. Yes.\n\nSo decimal value = 419430. Now we need number of bits in binary representation. Find highest power of two <= 419430. 2^19=524288, too high. 2^18=262144. 2^19 is too high. So highest power <= value is 2^18=262144. So value in binary will have 19 bits? Wait: If value is between 2^18 and 2^19-1 inclusive then number of bits is 19 (since need bits to represent). Since value 419430 < 2^19=524288 and >2^18=262144. So binary length = floor(log2(419430))+1. log2(419430) \u2248 18.68 so floor 18 then +1 =19. So answer 19 bits.",
