So it's a hex string. Need to convert to decimal or binary.\n\nCompute value: 6*16^4 + 6*16^3 + 6*16^2 + 6*16^1 + 6*16^0. That's 5 digits all 6. So compute.\n\n16^0=1\n16^1=16\n16^2=256\n16^3=4096\n16^4=65536\n\nSum: 6*(65536+4096+256+16+1)=6*(700 +? wait compute: 65536+4096=69632; +256=69888; +16=69904; +1=69905. Multiply by 6: 69905*6 = 419430? Let's compute: 69905*6 = 69905*3*2. 69905*3=209715; times 2 = 419430. Yes.\n\nSo decimal value is 419430.\n\nNow need number of bits in binary representation. Determine floor(log2(419430))+1. Compute 2^19=524288? Wait 2^19=524288. 2^18=262144. So 419430 is between 262144 and 524288. So needs 19 bits? Actually if number is less than 2^19, highest power less than number is 2^18=262144. So binary representation length = 19? Let's check: For numbers from 2^k to 2^(k+1)-1 inclusive, need k+1 bits. Here 419430 < 2^19, but > 2^18. So needs 19 bits. Because 2^18=262144, 2^19=524288. So value is between, so need 19 bits.\n\nAnswer: 19.\n\nCheck: 419430 in binary? 419430 = 2^19 - 860? Wait compute: 2^19 = 524,288. Subtract 419,430 = 104,858 difference. Not needed.\n\nThus answer: 19.",
