But leading zeros not counted. The first hex digit is 6 which is binary 0110. So the first hex digit has 3 bits (since leading zero). So total bits = 3 + 4*4 = 3+16=19 bits. Wait: representation: hex 6 -> binary 0110, but we don't count leading zero so 3 bits. Then each subsequent hex digit adds 4 bits. So total 3 + 4*4 = 3+16=19 bits. So answer: 19.",
