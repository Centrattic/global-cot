  "cot_content": "We need to find value of hex number 66666 (hex) in decimal then binary length. In hex, digits: 6 6 6 6 6. That's 5 hex digits. Each hex digit corresponds to 4 bits. So maximum bits 5*4=20 bits. But leading digit is 6 (0110). So first hex digit 6 corresponds to 4 bits: 0110. So the binary representation will be 20 bits? Actually hex digit 6 is 0110, so leading bits may have leading zero? The first hex digit is 6, which is 0110, so the most significant bit of binary representation is 0? In hex to binary, each hex digit gives exactly 4 bits, but leading zeros of the highest digit can be omitted. So the binary representation will have at most 20 bits, but the first bit could be zero. So we need actual number value: 0x66666 = in decimal. Let's compute: 6*16^4 + 6*16^3 + 6*16^2 + 6*16 +6. 16^4=65536. So 6*65536=393216. 16^3=4096. 6*4096=24576. 16^2=256. 6*256=1536. 16=16. 6*16=96. plus 6=6. Sum: 393216+24576=417792. plus 1536=419328. plus 96=419424. plus 6=419430. So decimal 419430. Now find binary length: 2^18=262144; 2^19=524288. So 419430 is between 2^18 and 2^19. So it requires 19 bits? Because the highest power of 2 less than number is 2^18 (262144). So the binary representation has 19 bits (since 2^18 to 2^19-1). So answer: 19 bits.",
