But leading digit '6' has binary 0110? But leading bit may be zero? Let's represent: hex 6 = 0110. So number has 5 digits: 6 6 6 6 6. Binary representation will have leading 0 bits? The first hex digit 6 has binary 0110, but leading zero may be omitted. So actual number of bits = 20 - leading zeros? First digit 6 in hex is binary 0110, but leading zero can be dropped giving 3 bits for that digit. But overall length? Highest non-zero bit is 1? Let's compute magnitude: 6*16^4 + 6*16^3 + ... etc. It's less than 16^5=1048576. It's around? 6*16^4=6*65536=393216. Sum others ~? So magnitude > 2^18? 2^18=262144. 393216 > 262144. So highest bit position is 18? Actually 393216 < 2^19=524288. So leading bit position maybe 18. So total bits = 19? Let's compute exact binary length: floor(log2(n)) +1. Compute n = 6*(16^4 + 16^3+16^2+16+1). 16^4=65536, 16^3=4096, 16^2=256, 16=16, +1=1. Sum=65536+4096+256+16+1=698... let's compute: 65536+4096=69632; +256=69888; +16=69904; +1=69905. multiply by6: 69905*6=419430. Wait 69905*6=419430. Good. So n=419430. Now log2(419430). 2^18=262144, 2^19=524288. So between 18 and19. So highest power 2^18 < n < 2^19. So floor(log2) =18. So bits needed =19. So answer 19.",
