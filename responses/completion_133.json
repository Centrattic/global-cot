That's hex number 0x66666. Convert to decimal or find binary length.\n\nCompute hex digits: each hex digit corresponds to 4 bits. 5 hex digits => up to 20 bits. But leading digit is 6 (0110). So the most significant nibble is 0110. So overall binary representation will be 20 bits, but leading zeros trimmed. Since first nibble is 0110, the leading bit is 0, but we ignore leading zeros. The number of bits needed equals floor(log2(n)) + 1. Let's compute decimal value: 0x66666 = 6*16^4 + 6*16^3 + 6*16^2 + 6*16 + 6. Let's compute: 16^1=16, 16^2=256, 16^3=4096, 16^4=65536. So 6*65536=393216, 6*4096=24576, 6*256=1536, 6*16=96, +6. Sum: 393216+24576=417792; add 1536=419328; plus 96=419424; plus 6=419430. So decimal 419430. Now find log2: 2^19=524288; 2^18=262144. So 419430 between 2^18 and 2^19, so needs 19 bits. So answer: 19 bits.",
