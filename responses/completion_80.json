So length <= 20 bits. But leading hex digit is 6 which is binary 0110. So highest bit is 0? Actually 6 in hex is binary 0110 (4 bits). So most significant bit is 0, so leading zeros not counted. So effective bits maybe 4*5=20 bits, but first digit 6 has leading 0, so first bit is 0. So actual bit count = 20-1=19? Let's check: 6 hex is 0110, so highest bit 0. So drop that leading 0. So we have 19 bits. But maybe there is another leading zero? Let's compute actual value: 6*16^4 + 6*16^3 +6*16^2+6*16+6 = 6*(65536+4096+256+16+1) =6*(699? wait sum: 65536+4096=69632; +256=69888; +16=69904; +1=69905. So value=6*69905=419430? 69905*6=419430. Indeed 6*69905=419430. So decimal 419430. In binary, that's 2^19? 2^19=524288. So less. 2^18=262144. So value between 2^18 and 2^19. So highest power of 2 less than value is 2^18=262144. Let's compute binary length: floor(log2(419430))=18? Actually 2^18=262144, 2^19=524288. Since 419430 <524288, highest set bit is position 18 (0-index). So bits needed = 19. So answer 19.",
