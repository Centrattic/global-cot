But leading hex digit is 6 which is binary 0110, but the leading bit may be zero? Wait 6 hex = 0110. The most significant hex digit is 6 which is binary 0110, leading zero maybe not counted? However representation normally doesn't include leading zeros. So the binary representation of hex 6 is 110 (without leading zero). So first hex digit \"6\" gives 3 bits. So total bits = 3 + 4*4=3+16=19. Thus answer 19 bits.",
