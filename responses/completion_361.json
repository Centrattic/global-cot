Compute its decimal value: 6*16^4 + 6*16^3 + 6*16^2 + 6*16^1 + 6*16^0 = 6*(16^4+16^3+16^2+16+1). Compute powers: 16^4=65536, 16^3=4096, 16^2=256, 16=16, 1. Sum = 65536+4096+256+16+1 = 698? Wait compute: 65536+4096=69632; +256=69888; +16=69904; +1=69905. Multiply by 6: 69905*6 = 419430? Let's compute: 69905*6 = (70000-95)*6=420000-570=419430. Yes 419430. So decimal value is 419430. Now find number of bits needed to represent 419430 in binary. Highest power of 2 less than or equal to 419430. Compute 2^19 = 524288 >; 2^18 = 262144. 419430-262144=157286. 2^17=131072 < remainder. 2^18 is 262144. So the binary representation will have 19 bits? Let's check: The highest power used is 2^18 (262144). Since value >2^18, need 19 bits? Actually if value >= 2^18, then highest bit position is 18 (0-indexed). Number of bits = floor(log2(n))+1. log2(419430) ~? 2^18=262144, 2^19=524288. So floor log2 = 18. So number of bits = 18+1=19. But check if value exactly equals 2^18? It's bigger, so 19 bits. So answer: 19.",
