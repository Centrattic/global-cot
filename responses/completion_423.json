So 5 hex digits => 20 bits if leading zeros allowed. But the highest hex digit is 6 (binary 0110). The first hex digit is 6, which is 0110, but leading zeros omitted. So the first two bits are 01? Actually 6 in hex is 0110 binary (4 bits). So the most significant hex digit \"6\" corresponds to binary 110 (since leading zero omitted). Wait 6 hex = decimal 6. In binary, 6 is 110. That's 3 bits. So the number of bits is 3 (for first hex digit) + 4*4 = 3 + 16 = 19? Let's compute: hex digits: 6 6 6 6 6. Convert to binary: 6 -> 110, next 6 -> 0110, etc. Represent: first digit 6 -> 110. Then each subsequent 6 -> 0110. So the binary string: 110 0110 0110 0110 0110. Count bits: first part 3 bits, then 4*4=16 bits. Total 19 bits. So answer 19.",
