  "cot_content": "We need to convert hex 66666 to binary digits count. 6 in hex is 0110 binary. The hex number 66666 in hex: that's 5 hex digits each '6'. So overall binary representation: each hex digit gives 4 bits. So 5*4=20 bits. But check leading zeros? The first hex digit is '6' which binary 0110. But the leading bit maybe zero, but we count significant bits: 6 hex digits? It's 5 hex digits: 6 6 6 6 6. The binary: 0110 0110 0110 0110 0110. Remove leading zeros: the first bit is 0, so first hex digit 6 is 0110; leading zero can be omitted. So bits: 0110 0110 0110 0110 0110 -> that's 20 bits but leading zero means first bit zero? Actually representation can start with '6' hex which is 0110. The most significant bit of this 20-bit string is 0, so the number actually has 19 bits? Let's compute value: hex 66666 = decimal? Each hex digit 6=6 decimal. So value = 6*16^4 +6*16^3+6*16^2+6*16+6. Calculate: 16^2=256, 16^3=4096, 16^4=65536. So =6*65536 +6*4096 +6*256 +6*16+6 = 393216+24576+1536+96+6=393216+24576=417792; +1536=419328; +96=419424; +6=419430. So decimal 419430. Binary representation? 419430 =? Let's find highest power of 2 less than that: 2^19=524288 > 419430; 2^18=262144 less. So need 19 bits? Actually bits needed: floor(log2(419430))+1. log2(419430) ~ 18.68. So need 19 bits. Let's check: 2^18=262144, 2^19=524288. So number <2^19, so need 19 bits. Therefore answer: 19 bits.",
