  "cot_content": "We need to convert hexadecimal number 66666 (base 16) to binary length. 66666 hex digits: each hex digit 4 bits. Number of hex digits = 5. So binary representation will have at most 20 bits, but leading zeros may reduce. Need to find value: hex 6 6 6 6 6 = 0x66666 = in decimal? Compute: 0x6=6. Use positional: 6*16^4 +6*16^3 +6*16^2 +6*16 +6. 16^4=65536, 16^3=4096, 16^2=256, 16=16. So value =6*65536 +6*4096 +6*256 +6*16 +6 = 393216 +24576 +1536 +96 +6 = 393216+24576=417792; +1536=419328; +96=419424; +6=419430. So decimal 419430. Binary length? Find highest power of 2 <=419430. 2^19=524288? Wait 2^19=524,288 >419k. 2^18=262,144. 2^19 exceeds. So highest power <=419430 is 2^18=262,144. Next 2^19 too high. So need to represent 419,430. In binary, number of bits = floor(log2(419430))+1. log2(419430) ~? 2^18=262144, 2^19=524,288. So log2 is between 18 and 19. floor=18. So bits=19. But check if leading bit 1 at position 18? Since number>262144 but <524288, need 19 bits. So answer 19.",
