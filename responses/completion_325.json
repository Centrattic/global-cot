  "cot_content": "We need to convert hex 66666 to binary length. Hex digits: 6=0110. So hex 66666 (five hex digits). In binary each hex digit is 4 bits. So number of bits = 5*4=20. But leading hex digits may have leading zeros? The most significant hex digit is 6 (0110), leading bit '0' is not counted. In binary representation, leading zeros not counted. So the binary representation starts with first '1' in 0110? The first hex digit 6 corresponds to binary 0110. The first bit is 0, but the next bits are 110. So the binary representation length is 3 bits? Wait, let's check: hex 6 = 110 in binary (3 bits). But if we treat as 4 bits, it's 0110. We drop leading zero. So the binary representation of the whole number will have length = 4*5 - leading zeros. The first hex digit 6 has leading zero, so we lose one bit. So total bits = 5*4 -1 = 19. Let's verify: hex digits: 6 6 6 6 6. The binary representation: 0110 0110 0110 0110 0110. Removing leading zero from first group: 110 0110 0110 0110 0110. Count bits: first group now 3 bits, plus 4*4=16 bits from remaining groups = 19 bits. So answer 19.",
