So total bits = 5*4 =20. But leading zeros may reduce? Most significant hex digit '6' is binary 0110, which has leading zero, but we don't count leading zeros. So number of binary digits =? 6 hex digits? Wait 5 hex digits, highest hex digit 6= binary 0110. Highest non-zero bit at position 3? '6' = 0110 binary: bits at positions 2,1 maybe. So the value is < 2^20, but > 2^19? Let's compute: 6*16^4 + 6*16^3 + 6*16^2 + 6*16 + 6 = 6*(65536 + 4096 + 256 + 16 + 1) = 6*(698? Actually sum: 65536+4096=69632; +256=69888; +16=69904; +1=69905. So total = 6*69905=419430? let's compute: 69905*6=419430? 69905*6=419430. Indeed 419430. Now binary length? 419430 decimal. In binary, 2^19=524,288; 2^18=262,144. So 419430 between 262144 and 524288. So binary digits: 18 bits? Actually highest power less than n: 2^18=262144, 2^19=524288. Since n<524288, highest bit position 18 (0-index). So number of bits = 19? Wait binary representation uses bits up to 18 index. Example: if n>=2^k then needs k+1 bits. For n between 2^k and 2^(k+1)-1 inclusive, requires k+1 bits. Here n=419430 between 262144(2^18) and 524288(2^19-1). So need 19 bits. So answer 19.",
