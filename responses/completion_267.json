Hex digits: 6 6 6 6 6. Each '6' -> binary 0110. So the most significant digit is 6, which in binary is 0110. The leading zero of that digit is not significant, so the first hex digit gives bits 3 bits (110). So total bits: first digit gives 3 bits, others give 4 bits each. So 3 + 4*4 = 3 + 16 = 19 bits. Check: 66666 hex = decimal? But we just need count. So answer 19.",
