So binary length = 5*4 =20 bits, but leading zeros maybe. Hex 6 => binary 0110. So number is 0b0110 0110 0110 0110 0110. Highest bit is 0? first digit 6 has binary 0110 so leading bit 0. So effectively 4*5-1=19 bits? Leading zero omitted. Since first digit 6 has leading zero, so number of bits is 19? Let's compute value: hex 6=6 decimal. So first digit 6 => bits 0110. So overall binary bits: 0110 0110 0110 0110 0110. The leading zero is omitted, so representation \"1100110011001100110\"? Wait starting with 0b1100? Actually 0110 => leading 0 omitted gives 110. But we need to keep grouping? Let's compute full binary: 6 hex => 0110. So 5 digits => 20 bits: 0110 0110 0110 0110 0110. Removing leading zero yields 19 bits? But first digit 6 gives leading bits 0110; first bit is 0. So we drop it, leaving 19 bits: 1100110011001100110. Count: 19 bits. Let's double-check: 5 hex digits => 20 bits. Highest bit is 0, so number of bits = 20-1 =19.\n\nThus answer: 19.",
