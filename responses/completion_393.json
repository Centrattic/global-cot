  "cot_content": "We need to interpret: base-16 number 66666 (hex) meaning digits '6' repeated 5 times. That is hex number: 0x66666. We need to express in base-2 and count number of bits (digits). So compute value: hex 6 = 110 in binary each digit 4 bits. So hex 66666 has 5 hex digits. Each hex digit 4 bits => 20 bits. But leading hex digit '6' is 0110, no leading zero. So total bits = 20. But check if leading zeros can be omitted. Highest hex digit '6' in binary 0110, but high-order bit 0? Actually 6 in binary is 110 (3 bits) but as 4 bits: 0110. But leading zero can be omitted because leading zeros are not counted. So the most significant bit will be 1 from the last two bits of '6'. So the highest bit is the 3rd bit of the 4-bit group of first digit. So the total bits maybe 18? Let's check: For hex 6: binary 110. But if you represent as 4 bits: 0110. The leading zero can be omitted, leaving 110 (3 bits). So each hex digit may contribute 3 or 4 bits depending. For 6, it's 3 bits. For digits 6 again, each subsequent hex digit adds 4 bits. So total bits = 3 + 4*4 = 3 + 16 = 19. Wait but need to confirm: For first digit '6', binary 110 (3 bits). For the remaining four '6's, each 4 bits. So total 3+4*4=3+16=19 bits. So answer: 19 bits. Let's output.",
