Let's interpret: number in hex \"66666\" (five digits) each hex digit = 4 bits. So raw bits = 5*4 =20 bits. But leading zeros may be omitted: highest hex digit is 6 (0b0110). So the most significant hex digit has value 6. Binary representation of 6 is 0110 (4 bits). But leading zero can be omitted, so the leading bit is 0? Actually representation of 6 is 110 (3 bits). So the first hex digit 6 corresponds to binary 0110, but leading zero omitted gives 110. So the total bits: first digit 6 gives 3 bits, then remaining 4 digits each 4 bits = 16 bits. Total 3+16 =19 bits. Wait check: second digit 6 as hex also 0110 (4 bits). But we keep full 4 bits. So 19 bits total. Ensure no further leading zeros. So answer 19.",
