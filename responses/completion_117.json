So length possibly 5 hex digits = 20 bits. But leading zeros may be omitted. Highest hex digit 6 non-zero. So binary representation length = number of bits needed to represent value. For hex digit 6 = binary 0110. So overall binary representation: 6 (0110) repeated 5 times gives 0110 0110 0110 0110 0110. But leading 0 doesn't count? The first hex digit 6 has binary 0110, leading zero may be omitted because most significant digit is 6 which in binary is 110 with 3 bits? Wait 6 hex = decimal 6. In binary 6 = 110. That's 3 bits. So the 5-digit hex number would be represented by 5*4=20 bits, but leading hex digit is 6 which binary 0110, leading zero can be omitted, so total bits maybe 19? But check: hex 6 => binary 110 (3 bits). So first digit 6 uses 3 bits. Then the remaining 4 digits each 4 bits => 4*4=16 bits. Total 3+16=19 bits. So answer 19.",
