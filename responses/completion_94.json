  "cot_content": "We need to convert 66666 (hex) to decimal, then express in binary. 66666 hex = digits: 6 6 6 6 6. Each hex digit is 4 bits. So total bits = 5*4 =20 bits. But leading zeros may be dropped. Highest hex digit is 6 (binary 0110). So first hex digit 6 -> 0110; but leading zero may drop? The first hex digit 6 has value 6 decimal. Binary representation of hex 6 = 110. But when writing 66666 hex, the first digit is 6, so the binary representation will start with binary of 6, which is 110. Wait: hex 6 = 0110 (4 bits). But leading zero is omitted. So overall binary length = 3 bits for first digit plus 4 bits each for remaining 4 digits: 3 + 4*4 = 3 + 16 = 19 bits. Let's double-check: hex 6 (decimal 6) binary is 110. 6 in hex: leading zeros omitted. So yes, 19 bits. Provide answer.",
