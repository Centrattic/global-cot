  "cot_content": "We need to compute length of binary representation of hex number 66666 (hex). This is hex digits '6','6','6','6','6'. In hex, each digit is 4 bits. So 5 hex digits => 5*4=20 bits, but leading zeros may be omitted. But the most significant hex digit is 6 (binary 0110). Since leading digit '6' is not zero, the first 4 bits will be '0110'. But the most significant bit among the 20 bits may be zero? Let's examine: hex 6 = 0110 in 4 bits. So the first bit of the 20-bit representation is 0, which may be omitted in binary representation. So actual number of bits needed is 19? Let's check: hex 66666 = hex value. Convert to decimal? Not needed. Determine binary length: the highest hex digit 6 is 6 decimal. In binary 6 = 110. So the first hex digit contributes 4 bits: 0110. The leading zero may be dropped, leaving 3 bits from first digit. But we must consider subsequent hex digits. Since the first hex digit is 6 (not 8 or higher), the leading bit is 0. Thus the first 4-bit group starts with 0. So effectively the binary representation has 3 bits from the first digit, plus full 4 bits for each of the remaining 4 digits (since they are 6). So total bits = 3 + 4*4 = 3 + 16 = 19. So answer: 19.",
