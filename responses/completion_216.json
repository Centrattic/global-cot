That's a hex number consisting of five digits '6' in hex.\n\nWe need to convert to decimal then to binary length (number of bits). The hex number 6 repeated 5 times. Let's compute its value: each hex digit is 4 bits. So hex number with 5 digits has up to 20 bits. But actual value may not use all. We need to find number of bits in binary representation.\n\nHex digits: '6' = decimal 6. So hex number: 6*16^4 + 6*16^3 + 6*16^2 + 6*16 + 6. Compute.\n\n16^0=1\n16^1=16\n16^2=256\n16^3=4096\n16^4=65536\n\nCompute: 6*65536 = 393,216\n6*4096 = 24,576\n6*256 = 1,536\n6*16 = 96\n6*1 = 6\n\nSum: 393,216+24,576=417,792\n+1,536=419,328\n+96=419,424\n+6=419,430\n\nSo decimal 419,430.\n\nNow find number of bits needed to represent this in binary. We need floor(log2(419,430)) + 1.\n\nCompute log2: 2^19 = 524,288. 2^18 = 262,144. So 419,430 between 2^18 and 2^19. So highest bit position is 18 (starting from 0). So number of bits = 19.\n\nCheck: 2^19 = 524,288 > 419,430, so need 19 bits.\n\nThus answer: 19.",
