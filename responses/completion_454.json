So 5 hex digits => 20 bits. But check leading zeros: hex number 66666 has most significant digit 6 which is non-zero, so exactly 5 hex digits. So number of bits = 5*4=20. However, we must consider that highest hex digit 6 is binary 0110. The leading bit of that group is 0, but that leading zero is within the group, but the first hex digit has bits 0110, leading zero is not significant. So the first hex digit (6) in binary is '110' (3 bits). So total bits = 3 + 4*4 = 3 + 16 = 19? Wait: 6 hex digit binary representation: 6=0110. The leading zero is not counted. So first hex digit uses only 3 bits (110). Then remaining 4 hex digits each 4 bits = 16 bits. Total 19 bits. So answer 19.\n\nCheck: hex 6 = 6 decimal. Binary: 110. yes. So answer 19.",
