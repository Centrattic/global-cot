Each hex digit 0-15. So number is 6*16^4 +6*16^3 +6*16^2 +6*16 +6. Compute: 16^2=256, 16^3=4096, 16^4=65536. So 6*65536 = 393216; 6*4096=24576; 6*256=1536; 6*16=96; +6. Sum: 393216+24576=417792; +1536=419328; +96=419424; +6=419430. So decimal 419,430. Now find number of bits needed to represent 419430 in binary. Highest power of two <= 419430. Compute powers: 2^18=262144, 2^19=524288. Since 419430 between, need 19 bits to represent (since up to 524287). So answer: 19 bits.",
