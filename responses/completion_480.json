So first digit '6' is binary 0110. So leading zero can be omitted? For a number, leading zeros not counted. So we need number of bits without leading zeros. For hex digit 6 (0b0110) has leading zero. So first digit contributes 3 bits? Actually 6 in binary is 110. So 3 bits. Then remaining 4 hex digits each 4 bits. So total 3+4*4=3+16=19 bits. But check if the leading digit could be 4 bits? Since hex 6 is 0110, leading zero omitted yields 110. So 3 bits. So answer 19.",
  "response_content": "The hexadecimal number \\(66666_{16}\\) has five hex digits.  \nEach hex digit normally represents 4 binary digits, giving \\(5\\times4=20\\) bits.  \nHowever, the leading hex digit is a \u201c6\u201d, whose binary representation is \\(0110\\).  \nDropping the leading zero leaves \\(110\\), which is only 3 bits.\n\nThus the number of binary digits (bits) needed to represent \\(66666_{16}\\) is  \n\n\\[\n3 \\text{ (from the first digit)} + 4\\cdot 4 = 3 + 16 = 19.\n\\]\n\n**Answer: 19**",
