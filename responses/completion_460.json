Value = 6*16^4 + 6*16^3 + 6*16^2 + 6*16 + 6 = 6*(16^4+16^3+16^2+16+1). Compute powers: 16^4=65536, 16^3=4096, 16^2=256, 16=16, 1=1. Sum = 65536+4096=69632; +256=69888; +16=69904; +1=69905. Times 6 = 419430. Wait 69905*6 = 419430? Let's compute: 70000*6=420000; subtract 95*6=570; 420000-570=419430. Yes. So decimal value = 419430. Now need number of bits in binary representation. For a positive integer n, number of bits = floor(log2(n))+1. Compute log2(419430). 2^19 = 524288. 2^18=262144. 419430 between, so bits = 19? Let's check: 2^18=262144, 2^19=524288. Since 419430 > 262144, so requires 19 bits. But need to confirm if leading bit is 1 and length is 19. Indeed 419430 < 524288 so representation length 19. Let's double-check: 419430 decimal in binary? Let's quick compute: 419430 = 2^19 - 83886? Wait 2^19=524288. 524288-419430=104858. So it's 524288-104858=419430. So binary would start with 1 at position 18 (counting from 0). So 19 bits. answer 19.",
