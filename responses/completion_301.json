Hex 6 = binary 0110 (but as 4 bits). For a hex number with 5 digits, normally 5*4=20 bits, but leading zeros in most significant hex digit may be omitted. The most significant hex digit is 6 (binary 0110). Leading bit zero can be omitted. So the length is 3 bits for that digit? Actually 6 in binary is 110, which is 3 bits. So total bits: first hex digit contributes 3 bits, then remaining 4 hex digits each contribute 4 bits. Total = 3 + 4*4 = 3 + 16 = 19 bits. So answer 19.",
