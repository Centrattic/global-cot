But leading zeros may reduce? The most significant hex digit is 6 (binary 0110). The leading bit of that is '0', so the number actually has 19 bits? Wait, 6 hex = binary 0110 (4 bits). But we don't count leading zeros. So the representation uses 4 bits for each hex digit but the first one may have leading zero bit. For hex digit 6, binary is 0110. The leading zero is not necessary. So the most significant hex digit is 6, which in binary 0110. That's 3 bits (110). So total bits = 3 + 4*4 = 3 + 16 = 19. Let's verify: For 5 hex digits, maximum bits = 20, but since first hex digit 6 has leading zero, effective bits = 19. So answer 19.",
