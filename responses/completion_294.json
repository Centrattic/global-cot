Each hex digit is 4 bits, so representation in binary could be up to 20 bits, but leading zeros may reduce. Need to determine the highest bit position of the value.\n\nCompute value: Each hex digit 6 corresponds to 6 decimal. So value = 6*16^4 + 6*16^3 + 6*16^2 + 6*16 + 6.

Actually bits from 0 to 18 inclusive => 19 bits. But check if leading zeros unnecessary: The most significant bit position is 18 (since 2^18=262144 < 419430 < 2^19). So number of bits = 19.
