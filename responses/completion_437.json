Compute.\n\n16^1=16, 16^2=256, 16^3=4096, 16^4=65536.\n\nSo value = 6*65536 + 6*4096 + 6*256 + 6*16 + 6 = 393216 + 24576 + 1536 + 96 + 6 = 393216+24576=417792. Then +1536=419328. +96=419424. +6=419430. So decimal 419430.\n\nNow find number of binary digits needed to represent 419430 (decimal). Compute powers of 2. 2^18=262144. 2^19=524288. So it's between 2^18 and 2^19. So highest power less than number is 2^18=262144, next 2^19=524288 >419430. So requires 19 bits? Actually number less than 2^19 but greater than 2^18-1. The bit length is floor(log2(n))+1. log2(419430) ~? 2^18=262144, 2^19=524288. So log2 is between 18 and 19. So floor log2 = 18. So bits = 18+1=19.\n\nAnswer: 19.",
