So total bits = 5*4 =20 bits. But leading hex digit is 6 which is binary 0110, so first hex digit may have leading zeros omitted. The number's most significant hex digit is 6 which binary 0110; the leading zero bit may be omitted, so total bits = 5*4 -1 =19 bits? but need to check if it's exactly 19? 0x6 = binary 110; the first hex digit gives 3 bits. So total bits= 3+4*4=3+16=19. So answer 19.",
