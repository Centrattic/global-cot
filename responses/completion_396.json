Value = 6*16^4 + 6*16^3 + 6*16^2 + 6*16 + 6. Let's compute: 16^2=256, 16^3=4096, 16^4=65536. So 6*65536=393216; 6*4096=24576; 6*256=1536; 6*16=96; +6. Sum: 393216+24576=417792; +1536=419328; +96=419424; +6=419430. So decimal 419430. Now binary length: find floor(log2(419430))+1. Compute power of two: 2^19=524288. 2^18=262144. 2^19 > value, so highest power <=419430 is 2^18. Actually 2^18=262144. 2^19=524288 too high. So 2^18 <=419430<2^19. So number of bits = 19? Wait for value between 2^18 and 2^19-1 inclusive, need 19 bits because largest value requires 19 bits. For 419430 < 524288, so binary length = 19. Confirm: 2^18=262144 binary 19 bits? Actually 2^18 requires 19 bits? 2^18 is 262144 decimal, its binary has bits from 0 to 18 inclusive? 2^18 uses 19 bits? Let's think: 2^0 to 2^18: that's 19 numbers. So 2^18 in binary is 1 followed by 18 zeros: that uses 19 bits? Wait representation: 2^0 uses 1 bit. So 2^18 uses 19 bits. So any number less than 2^19 uses 19 bits maximum. So answer 19.",
