  "cot_content": "We need to find the binary representation length of the hex number 66666 (hex). So hex \"66666\" meaning digits: 6 6 6 6 6 in base 16. That's a 5-digit hex number. Convert to decimal? 6*16^4 + 6*16^3 + 6*16^2 + 6*16 + 6. Compute: 16^2=256, 16^3=4096,16^4=65536. So value =6*(65536+4096+256+16+1)=6*(65536+4096=69632; +256=69888; +16=69904; +1=69905). Sum=69905. Multiply by 6: 69905*6=419430. Wait check: 69905*6 = 419430 (since 70k*6=420k minus 70*6? Actually 69905*6=419430). Yes.\n\nSo decimal = 419430. Now find its binary representation length. 419430 in binary? Note that 2^19 = 524,288; 2^18 = 262,144. So 419430 between 2^18 and 2^19. So highest power less than equal to is 2^18=262,144. So need to express 419430-262144=157286. That's 2^17=131,072. remainder 26,214. 2^14=16,384 remainder 9,830. 2^13=8,192 remainder 1,638. 2^10=1,024 remainder 614. 2^9=512 remainder 102. 2^6=64 remainder 38. 2^5=32 remainder 6. 2^2=4 remainder 2. 2^1=2 remainder 0.\n\nSo binary digits positions: 18,17,14,13,10,9,6,5,2,1. That's 10 bits set. But total number of bits needed = floor(log2(419430))+1. Since 2^18=262144 <= 419430 < 2^19. So number of bits = 19. Because need bits from 0 to 18 inclusive: that's 19 bits. So answer: 19.",
