  "cot_content": "We need to convert 66666_hex to binary and count bits. 66666 hex digits: hex digits: 6 6 6 6 6. Each hex digit is 4 bits. So 5 digits => 20 bits. But leading zeros may be omitted? If the most significant hex digit is 6 (binary 0110). That's non-zero, so all 5 digits count. So 20 bits. But check: hex 6 = 0110. So first nibble 0110 => leading zeros maybe suppressed? For most significant digit 6, binary representation starts with 0110, which has leading zero. But the most significant bit is the 4th bit of that nibble? Actually 6 hex = 0110. The most significant bit is 0, so the first bit of the number is 0. So the first non-zero bit occurs at second bit of that nibble. So total bits: we can count from that first 1. Let's write hex 6 6 6 6 6 -> binary sequence: 0110 0110 0110 0110 0110. That's 20 bits. But the leading zero can be omitted, leaving 19 bits? Let's check: first nibble 0110: bits: 0 1 1 0. The first 1 is at second position. So leading zero omitted: we have 19 bits? Actually 0110 -> if we drop leading zero we get 110. That's 3 bits. So total bits = (first nibble 3 bits) + (remaining 4 nibbles * 4 bits each) = 3 + 16 = 19. But careful: The first nibble is 0110 which is 4 bits; value 6. In binary representation, leading zeros are not counted. So representation of 6 hex is 110. So we have 3 bits for first nibble. Then next four nibbles each 4 bits. So total bits = 3 + 4*4 = 3 + 16 = 19. So answer: 19 bits.",
