So first digit gives 4 bits, but leading zeros may reduce. For hex 6xxxx, value starts with binary 0110 followed by other bits. So total bits = 1 (since leading digit 6 has binary 0110, but leading zero not counted). So first digit gives 3 bits? Actually hex 6 is 0110, leading zero suppressed, so gives 3 bits (110). So total bits = 3 + 4*4 = 3+16=19. So answer 19.",
