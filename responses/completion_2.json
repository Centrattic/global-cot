Let's compute: value = 6*16^4 +6*16^3 +6*16^2 +6*16 +6.\n\nCompute powers: 16^1=16, 16^2=256, 16^3=4096, 16^4=65536.\n\nSo value =6*65536 +6*4096 +6*256 +6*16 +6.\n\nCompute each: 6*65536=393,216. 6*4096=24,576. 6*256=1,536. 6*16=96. +6.\n\nSum: 393,216+24,576=417,792. +1,536=419,328. +96=419,424. +6=419,430. So decimal 419,430.\n\nNow find binary length: need floor(log2(n))+1. Compute log2(419,430). 2^19=524,288. 2^18=262,144. So it's between. 419,430>262,144. Let's find binary representation maybe 419,430 = 256*? Wait 419,430 = 0x66666 hex? Actually 0x66666 decimal 419,430.\n\nNow find highest power of 2 less than or equal: 2^18=262,144. 2^19=524,288 > n. So number of bits = 19? Wait if highest power <=n is 2^18, then bits needed = 19? Because need bits up to position 18. So number of bits= floor(log2(n))+1 = 18+1=19. Check if n is exactly power of 2? no.\n\nThus answer 19.",
