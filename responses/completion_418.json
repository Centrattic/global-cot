Value = 6*(16^4 + 16^3 + 16^2 + 16 + 1). 16^0=1. 16^1=16. 16^2=256. 16^3=4096. 16^4=65536. Sum = 1+16+256+4096+65536 = 699? Let's sum: 65536+4096=69632. +256=69888. +16=69904. +1=69905. Multiply by 6: 69905*6 = 419430? Wait compute: 69905*6 = 419430. Indeed 69905*6 = 419430. So decimal value is 419430. Need number of bits in binary representation. Determine highest power of 2 less than or equal to 419430. 2^19=524288. 2^18=262144. 2^19 is too high. So between 2^18 and 2^19. So number of bits = floor(log2(419430))+1. Let's compute 419430 in binary length. 419430 / 2 = 209715. That's 2^? 209715 = 2^? 2^17=131072, 2^18=262144. So 209715 is between. So 419430 is between 2^18 and 2^19. Thus floor log2 = 18. So bits = 19? Wait if value < 2^19, then highest power is 2^18. So need 19 bits? Let's test: 2^18=262144. 2^19=524288. Since 419430 between, bits needed = 19? Example: for number 3 (binary 11) needs 2 bits. For number between 4 and 7 inclusive, need 3 bits. So indeed for number between 2^k and 2^(k+1)-1 inclusive, need k+1 bits. Since 419430 between 2^18 and 2^19-1, need 19 bits. Thus answer 19.",
