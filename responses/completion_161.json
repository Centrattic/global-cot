  "cot_content": "We need to convert hex 66666 (hex string) to binary length. Interpret as hex digits: 6 6 6 6 6. In hex each digit 4 bits. So hex length 5 digits => 20 bits. But leading digit is 6, which is binary 0110. Most significant bit of first digit may be zero. So actual length may be less than 20 if leading zeros omitted. Convert 0x66666. Let's find its decimal: 6*16^4 + 6*16^3 +6*16^2 +6*16 +6. Compute: 16^1=16,16^2=256,16^3=4096,16^4=65536. 6*(65536+4096+256+16+1) =6*(69849)=419,? Wait 65536+4096=69632; +256=69888; +16=69904; +1=69905. Multiply by 6: 419,430? compute: 69905*6=419,430. Yes value = 419430 decimal. Now find highest power of 2 less than or equal. 2^18=262144, 2^19=524288. So 419430 between them, so need 19 bits to represent? Highest power less than value is 2^18=262144. Need bits up to 2^18. Since 2^19 > value, the bit at position 19 (0-indexed?) Wait bits count: For integer N, number of bits needed is floor(log2(N))+1. log2(419430)=? 2^18=262144, 2^19=524288. So floor log2 =18. So bits=19. So answer 19.",
