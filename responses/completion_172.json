Let's compute: 16^1=16, 16^2=256, 16^3=4096, 16^4=65536. Sum: 6*65536=393216; 6*4096=24576; 6*256=1536; 6*16=96; 6=6. Total=393216+24576=417792; +1536=419328; +96=419424; +6=419430. So value = 419430 decimal. Binary length? Find highest power of 2 less than or equal to 419430. 2^18=262144, 2^19=524288. So it's between. So need 19 bits to represent (since 2^19 > value). So binary representation would have 19 bits. Answer: 19.",
