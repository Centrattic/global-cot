So total bits = 5*4=20 bits. But leading hex digit is 6 (binary 0110). The most significant bits: hex 6 is binary 0110. Since leading digit not zero, the most significant bit is 0? Actually 0110 has leading 0 but the value 6 in hex is 6 decimal. The binary representation of 6 hex digit: 6 hex = 0110 binary. The most significant bit is 0 but we don't count leading zeros. The first hex digit 6 in binary is 0110 which has leading zero. So the overall binary representation will start with 0110... But the most significant bit is 0 so we effectively have 19 bits? Wait: 6 hex = decimal 6. In binary: 110 (3 bits). Yes because 6 decimal is 110 binary. So the first hex digit does not produce 4 bits; it produces 3 bits. So total bits = (first digit 6 gives 3 bits) + 4*(4 remaining digits) = 3 + 16 = 19 bits. Thus answer 19.",
