  "cot_content": "We need to convert hex number 66666 (base-16) to binary to count bits. Hex digits: '6' hex digit = 0110 binary. So each hex digit corresponds to 4 bits. Number has 5 digits: 6 6 6 6 6. So total bits = 5*4 = 20 bits. But leading zero bits may not counted if first digit is zero. Here first digit is '6', which is binary 0110. Most significant digit '6' -> leading bits: 0110. Leading zero? It's 0 as first bit? In binary representation, we omit leading zeros. The most significant bit of the first digit is 0, but since it's 0110, the first non-zero is 1 at second bit. So representation would start with '110' maybe? Let's compute: hex 6 -> binary 0110. So 5 hex digits produce 20 bits, but the leading zero can be omitted, leaving 19 bits? Actually 0110 0110 0110 0110 0110. The first bit is 0, so we drop it, leaving 19 bits. But check: 0110 has leading zero; we can drop that zero. So total bits = 19. Let's verify: hex 6 6 6 6 6 -> binary: 0110 0110 0110 0110 0110. Remove leading zero: 110 0110 0110 0110 0110? Wait need to be careful: The first group: 0110. Dropping the leading zero yields 110. That's 3 bits. Then plus 4*4 bits for remaining groups? Actually each subsequent group is 4 bits. So total bits = 3 + 4*4 = 3+16=19. Yes. So answer: 19.",
