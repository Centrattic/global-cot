So 5 hex digits => 20 bits. But leading zeros may be omitted? Highest hex digit is 6 which in binary 0110, but leading zeros of the most significant digit? For hex number 6... the first hex digit is 6, which binary '0110'. The most significant bits: the leading '0' can be omitted, so the number has 4 bits per digit but first digit may have less than 4 bits. For 6 hex, the value is 6 decimal. Binary representation of 6 is '110'. So the first hex digit contributes 3 bits. The remaining 4 hex digits contribute 4 bits each = 16 bits. Total bits = 3+16=19. So answer 19.",
