But leading zeros may not count. Since leading hex digit is 6 (binary 0110). The first bit is 0? Wait 6 hex = binary 0110. But leading 0 bit might be omitted. So we need number of bits for the value. Represent 6 hex digit 6: 0110. The most significant bit is 0, so effectively only 3 bits? Actually value 6 decimal = 110 in binary (3 bits). So first digit contributes 3 bits. So total bits = 3 + 4*4 = 3+16=19 bits. But need to verify: 0x6 = decimal 6. 0x66 = 102 decimal? Let's compute: 6*16+6=102. Binary of 102 is 1100110 (7 bits). So 0x66 is 7 bits. 0x666 is 102*16+6=1638? Actually 102*16+6=1638. Binary length? 1638 decimal ~ 2^10=1024 <1638<2048 so 11 bits. 0x6666= 1638*16+6 = 26214? Actually 1638*16=26208 +6=26214. Binary length? 26214 ~ between 2^14=16384 and 2^15=32768 so 15 bits. 0x66666 = 26214*16+6=419,?? Let's compute: 26214*16=419424; +6=419430. Decimal 419430. Binary length? 2^19=524288 >419430, 2^18=262144 <419430. So 19 bits. So answer 19.",
