  "cot_content": "We need to convert hex number 66666 (hex) to binary length. In hex, each hex digit corresponds to 4 bits. Number 66666 hex has 5 hex digits. But leading hex digits might be zero? Highest hex digit is 6, which is non-zero, so the highest-order bit is 1. Thus total bits = 5*4 = 20.\n\nBut check: hex 6 = 0110 binary. So each hex digit 6 gives 4 bits. So 5 digits -> 20 bits. However, if the highest hex digit 6 could have leading zeros trimmed: 6 in hex is 0110 binary, so the leading 0 bit could be omitted? In binary representation, we usually don't write leading zeros. The first hex digit 6 corresponds to binary 110 (since leading zero omitted). So actual bits: 6 (0110) but leading zero omitted gives 3 bits? Let's compute: 6 hex = binary 110. But that's 3 bits. Wait 6 decimal is 110 binary (3 bits). In hex representation, each hex digit corresponds to 4 bits, but leading zeros can be omitted. For hex 6, the binary is 0110, but we can drop the leading 0, leaving 110 (3 bits). So the first hex digit contributes 3 bits, but subsequent digits 4 bits each.\n\nThus total bits = 3 + (4*4)=3+16=19 bits. Let's verify: 66666 hex in decimal? Not needed. Let's compute precisely: hex digits: 6 6 6 6 6. The leading digit is 6, binary 110. So 3 bits. Others: each 6 gives 4 bits. So total 3+4*4=3+16=19 bits. So answer: 19.",
