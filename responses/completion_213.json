Wait: \"base-16 number 66666\" probably means the hexadecimal number 66666 (five digits). So value = 6*16^4 + 6*16^3 +6*16^2 +6*16 +6. Let's compute.\n\n16^1=16, 16^2=256, 16^3=4096, 16^4=65536.\n\nCompute: 6*65536=393216\n6*4096=24576\n6*256=1536\n6*16=96\n6*1=6\n\nSum: 393216+24576=417792\n417792+1536=419328\n419328+96=419424\n419424+6=419430\n\nSo decimal value 419430.\n\nWe need number of bits in binary representation of 419430. Let's find the highest power of 2 less than or equal to that.\n\nCompute powers: 2^18=262144, 2^19=524288 > 419430. So highest power less is 2^18.\n\nThus binary representation will have 19 bits? Wait: if highest power is 2^18 (i.e., 262144) then the representation uses bits from 2^18 down to 2^0. Number of bits = 19 (since indices 0..18 inclusive). So answer: 19 bits. Check if 2^18 <= 419430 < 2^19, correct. So answer 19.",
