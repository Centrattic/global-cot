But leading zeros trimmed? The number in hex: 0x66666. In binary, the most significant hex digit is 6 which in binary is 0110. But the leading zero bit may be dropped; but they ask how many base-2 digits (bits) does it have? Usually we count significant bits, so leading zero not counted. 0x6 has leading zero bits: 6 in binary is 110, but as 4 bits it's 0110. The leading zero is not counted. So the first hex digit 6 maps to binary 110 (3 bits). So total bits: For digits: 6 6 6 6 6. The first digit 6 contributes 3 bits, the rest 4 bits each: 3 + 4*4 = 3 + 16 = 19 bits. So answer 19.",
