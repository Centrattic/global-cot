  "cot_content": "We need convert hex 0x66666 to binary length. 66666 hex digits: 5 hex digits. Each hex digit 4 bits. So 5*4=20 bits. But leading zeros? 0x66666 is 5 hex digits; highest hex digit 6 not zero, so 20 bits. But check if leading zeros trimmed: highest hex digit is 6 (binary 0110). So the first hex digit uses 4 bits but leading zero bit could be omitted? 6 in binary 0110, leading zero can be omitted, so actual bits needed: hex 6 has binary 110. So first digit uses 3 bits. So total bits: 3 + 4*4=3+16=19 bits. Let's compute: 0x6=110b. So representation: 6 6 6 6 6 hex digits. So binary: 6:110, 6:110, 6:110, 6:110, 6:110. Concatenate: 110110110110110110. Count bits: 3*5=15? Wait each 6 uses 3 bits, but 5 digits => 15 bits. Wait but we need 5 hex digits each 4 bits? But leading zeros omitted reduces. For 6 hex = 0110 but leading zero omitted gives 110. So indeed each 6 is 3 bits. So total 5*3=15 bits. However consider adjacent digits: 6 6 => need to ensure no overlap: representation: 6(110) 6(110) 6(110) 6(110) 6(110). Concat: 110110110110110110. Count: that's 18 bits? Let's count: each 3 bits *5=15. Wait but concatenation: 3+3+3+3+3=15. But check actual string: 110 110 110 110 110 = 15 bits. So answer 15.",
