So length = 5*4 =20 bits. But leading bits may be zero? The most significant hex digit is 6 which is binary 0110. The leading zero could be omitted. So actual binary digits count = 20 - leading zeros? For hex digit 6, binary 0110 has leading zero. So first hex digit contributes only 3 bits? Actually hex digit 6 = binary 0110, leading zero optional. So highest non-zero bit is the 3rd bit of that group. So total bits = (first hex digit 6 contributes 3 bits) + 4*4 for remaining four hex digits = 3 + 16 = 19 bits. So answer 19.",
