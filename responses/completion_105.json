Compute 16^2=256;16^3=4096;16^4=65536.\n\nSo compute: 6*65536=393,216. 6*4096=24,576. 6*256=1,536. 6*16=96. +6.\n\nSum: 393216+24576=417,792. +1536=419,328. +96=419,424. +6=419,430.\n\nSo decimal value = 419,430. Need number of bits in binary representation. Find highest power of 2 <= that. 2^18=262,144; 2^19=524,288 >. So highest power less than 419,430 is 2^18=262,144. So bits needed = 19? Wait if value < 2^19, need 19 bits to represent? For numbers from 2^18 to 2^19-1 inclusive require 19 bits. Since 419,430 < 524,288, so need 19 bits. So answer: 19.",
