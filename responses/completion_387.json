  "cot_content": "We need to convert hex number 66666 (base 16). So digits: 6 6 6 6 6 hex. That's 5 hex digits. Each hex digit corresponds to 4 bits. So would be 5*4=20 bits. But leading zeros? The most significant digit is 6, which is binary 0110. So 20 bits. However sometimes they might ask number of bits in binary representation (ignoring leading zeros). 6 hex = 0110, leading zero may be omitted: 3 bits? For each hex digit, you might drop leading zeros. But representation may be 5 hex digits, the most significant nibble is 6 => 0110. Dropping leading zero yields 3 bits. So total bits: 3 + 4*4 = 3+16=19 bits. Wait check: first nibble 6 binary 0110 (4 bits). Remove leading zero gives 110? Actually 6 decimal is 0110, removing leading zero gives 110 (3 bits). So total 3 + 4*4 = 19. So answer 19.",
