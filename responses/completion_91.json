But leading digit 6 is non-zero, so bits = 5*4 =20 bits. However, leading hex digit 6 binary is 0110, but leading zero omitted. So bits? For hex digit 6 (binary 0110) highest bit is 0 so leading zeros trimmed. So actually the highest bit is in that digit's high bit? 6 in hex is 0110. The highest set bit is the third bit (from left). So for 5 hex digits, we need 3+? Let's compute value: hex 66666 = 6*16^4 +6*16^3+... etc. The highest hex digit 6 at position 4 (16^4). 6=110 in binary? 6 decimal = 110 binary 3 bits. But leading zeros trimmed: 6 decimal in binary is 110. So the leading hex digit contributes 3 bits. Then remaining 4 hex digits each contribute 4 bits: 4*4=16. Total bits =3+16=19. So answer 19.",
