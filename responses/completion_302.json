  "cot_content": "We need to convert hex 66666 hex to binary length. Compute value: hex digits: 6 6 6 6 6. In hex, each digit is 4 bits. So 5 hex digits -> 20 bits. But leading digit 6 (binary 0110) so first bit is 0, but we consider significant bits. Highest hex digit is 6 which is binary 0110, so the leading bit is 0. So effectively length is 19? Let's check: hex 6 = 6 decimal. In binary: 0110. So the most significant bit is 0, so the number of bits needed is less than 20. Let's compute actual value: hex 66666 = 6*16^4 + 6*16^3 + 6*16^2 + 6*16 + 6. Compute: 16^4=65536; times6 = 393216. 16^3=4096; times6=24576. 16^2=256; times6=1536. 16*6=96. +6=6. Sum: 393216+24576=417792. Add 1536 => 419328. Add 96 => 419424. Add 6 => 419430. So value = 419430 decimal. Binary of 419430? 419430 = 2^19 - 2? Wait 2^19=524288. 2^18=262144. 419430 between. Let's compute bits. Represent: 419430 in binary. 419430 decimal = 419430. Let's find highest power of 2 less than it. 2^18=262144. 2^19=524288. So leading bit at position 18 (0-index). So number of bits = 19. So answer: 19 bits.",
