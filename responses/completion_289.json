However leading zeros may be omitted but we count digits in binary representation without leading zeros. The most significant bit is the leftmost bit of the most significant hex digit 6: binary 0110. But the first hex digit 6 has leading zero, so the highest non-zero bit is 1 at second position? Let's check: 6 hex = 0110 binary. So the hex number 66666 has first digit 6, but leading zero bit is omitted. So binary representation starts with first '1' in that 0110 => the first bit is 1 at position 2 (from left). So the total number of bits: 20 - 1 = 19? Let's compute: 5 hex digits *4=20 bits. The first 4-bit group is 0110. Dropping leading zero leaves 3 bits from that group: 110. Then remaining 4 groups each 4 bits: 16 bits. Total 3+16=19 bits. So answer 19.",
