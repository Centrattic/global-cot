Each hex digit is 4 bits. So total bits potentially 5*4=20 bits. But leading zeros can be omitted. Highest non-zero hex digit is first digit 6 (binary 0110). So most significant hex digit is '6' which in binary is 0110. That has leading zero. So actual number of bits would be 3? Wait 6 binary 0110 -> leading zeros omitted, so 3 bits? Actually 6 in binary is 110 (3 bits). So for hex '6', the first digit is 6, not zero; binary representation of 6 is 110. So overall number length: first hex digit contributes 3 bits (since 6 in binary 110). Then each subsequent hex digit contributes 4 bits. So total bits: 3 + 4*4 = 3 + 16 = 19 bits. So answer 19.\n\nCheck: Hex number 0x66666. Convert to decimal? Not needed. Count bits: 6 = 0110. But we don't include leading zero. So 110. So 3 bits. Then next four digits each add 4 bits ->16 bits. Total 19 bits.\n\nThus answer: 19.",
