  "cot_content": "We need to convert hex number 66666 (base16) to binary length. 66666 hex digits: 5 hex digits. Each hex digit is 4 bits, so total bits = 5*4 =20 bits. But leading zeros may be omitted: the first hex digit is '6' which binary 0110, not zero. So need number of bits in binary representation without leading zeros. The highest value of first hex digit '6' is binary 0110 meaning first bit is 0 but leading zero omitted. For hex digit 6, binary is 0110 (4 bits). The most significant bit is 0, but we drop leading zero, so we have 3 bits? Wait 6 in binary is 110 (three bits). Since hex digit 6 is 0110, but leading zero omitted, so 3 bits. But we have 5 hex digits, so total bits = 3 + (4*4)=3+16=19. Actually need to consider that the leading hex digit 6 has binary 0110, which is 3 bits. So total bits = 3 + 4*4=3+16=19. Therefore answer 19.",
