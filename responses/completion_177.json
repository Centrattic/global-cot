In binary representation, leading zeros omitted. The highest hex digit is 6 (0110). So the most significant hex digit is 6, which in binary is 0110, but leading zero omitted. So highest significant bits: 110. Wait 6 in hex = 6 decimal = 0110 binary. So the first hex digit 6 yields bits \"110\" after dropping leading zero. So the total bits = 3 + 4*4 = 3 + 16 = 19? Let's verify: 5 hex digits, represent 5*4=20 bits. But the first hex digit has leading zero for the bit pattern 0110, but we drop leading zeros. So we drop one leading zero, making 19 bits. So answer 19.",
