  "cot_content": "We need to convert hex number 66666 (in base 16) to decimal, then to binary length. 66666 hex = digits: 6 6 6 6 6. Each hex digit is 4 bits. So 5 hex digits => up to 20 bits. But leading digit is 6, which in binary is 0110. So first hex digit 6 => 0110 (4 bits). But leading zero may be omitted. So the most significant bits: 6 => binary 110? Wait 6 hex = 0110 binary. The leading hex digit 6 has binary 110 but with leading zero? Actually 6 hex = binary 0110. But when writing the number, we don't include leading zeros. So the first hex digit 6 corresponds to binary 110 (3 bits). But need to consider that 6 hex is 4 bits but leading zero can be omitted. So total bits = (number of hex digits -1)*4 + leading bits in first digit. For 6 hex, leading bits =3. So total bits= (5-1)*4+3=4*4+3=19? Wait compute: 4*4=16; 16+3=19. So answer 19.",
