But check if leading zeros? The first digit is 6 (binary 0110). The leading hex digit 6 is non-zero so the highest bit is 0? Actually binary representation of 6 in hex as leading digit: 6 in hex is 0110 in 4 bits. So the most significant bit of the entire number is 0? Actually 6 hex => binary 0110. So the most significant bit is 0. But the binary representation may drop leading zeros; we consider number of bits without leading zeros. For hex 6 at the front, the binary representation could start with 0110: the leading 0 can drop, so the first bit is 1? Wait, 6 hex is 0110 in 4 bits. But the number has 5 hex digits: first digit 6 corresponds to four bits: 0110. The leading zero could be omitted, leaving 110. But then the next hex digit 6 adds 4 bits, etc. So we need total bits: the binary representation will have 1 less than 20? Let's check: 6 hex = 6 decimal. In binary: 110. But that's 3 bits. However the representation could be 0110 but we discard leading zero. So the first hex digit 6 yields 3 bits. Then each subsequent hex digit adds 4 bits. So total bits: 3 + (4*4) = 3 + 16 = 19 bits. But check: hex 6 has binary 110 (3 bits). So resulting binary length is 3+4*(4)=3+16=19 bits. So answer 19.",
