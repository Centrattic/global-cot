But we need number of bits in binary representation of the integer value when written in base 2. The leading zeros omitted. So we need to find the binary representation length. Since each hex digit is exactly 4 bits, but the leading hex digit is 6 (binary 0110). The most significant hex digit 6 has binary 0110 (4 bits). But the leading bit of that is 0? Wait 6 in binary is 110. Actually 6 decimal = 0110 (4 bits). The leading 0 can be omitted. So the first hex digit 6 corresponds to binary bits '110' (3 bits). So the total length: 5 hex digits *4 =20 bits, minus 1 leading zero =19 bits. Let's double-check: hex 6 = binary 0110 (4 bits). But leading zero can be omitted. So the first hex digit yields 3 bits. Then each of the remaining 4 hex digits contribute 4 bits each: 4*4=16. Total 19 bits. So answer 19.",
