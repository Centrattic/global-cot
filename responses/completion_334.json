So total bits = 5 digits *4 =20 bits. But leading zeros may not be present. Highest hex digit is 6 which is >0. So binary representation will be 20 bits? But we need minimal number of bits needed to represent that number in binary, which is floor(log2(n))+1. For 66666 hex = hex value. Let's compute decimal: hex 6=6. So value = 6*16^4 +6*16^3+6*16^2+6*16+6.\n\nCompute: 16^2=256, 16^3=4096, 16^4=65536.\n\nSo value =6*65536 +6*4096 +6*256 +6*16 +6 = 393216 +24576 +1536 +96 +6 = 420,? compute: 393216+24576=417792; +1536=419328; +96=419424; +6=419430. So decimal =419430.\n\nNow determine number of bits needed: highest power of 2 less than or equal to 419430. 2^19=524288, too high. 2^18=262144. 2^19=524288 >419430. So highest power <=419430 is 2^18? Wait 2^18=262144. 2^19 too high. So largest power <=419430 is 2^18=262144. So need bits up to 18? The binary length is floor(log2(n))+1. log2(419430)=? Since 2^19=524288 >419430. 2^18=262144 <=. So log2(n)= between 18 and 19. floor=18. So bits=19. Yes 19 bits.\n\nThus answer: 19.",
