So length is at most 5*4=20 bits. But leading digit is 6 which binary 0110. So first digit has leading zeros maybe not. For hex 6 (most significant) has binary 0110. So the most significant bits not zero? 6 decimal = binary 110. In 4 bits: 0110. The leading zero is not counted. So bits needed = 3 + 4*4? Wait.\n\nBetter: hex 66666 hex = 6*16^4 + 6*16^3 + 6*16^2 + 6*16 + 6. Compute decimal? maybe large. Let's compute binary length: For hex digit 6, its binary representation is 0110. But the most significant digit cannot have leading zeros counted. So the first digit 6 has binary 110 (without leading zero). So the length = 3 (for most significant digit) + 4*4 = 3+16=19 bits. Wait check: 5 hex digits: first digit 6: binary 110 (3 bits). The remaining 4 digits each 4 bits. So total 3 + 4*4 = 3 + 16 = 19 bits. So answer 19.",
