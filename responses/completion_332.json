  "cot_content": "We need to convert hex number 66666 (hex) to binary length. 66666 hex = digits: 6 6 6 6 6. Each hex digit is 4 bits. So number of bits = 5*4=20 bits. However leading zeros may be omitted. The most significant hex digit is 6 (binary 0110). That has leading zero. So actual length is 4*5 =20 bits? But leading zero maybe not counted. Most significant digit 6 binary 0110 -> leading zero omitted => 3 bits for that digit? Wait 6 binary: 0110 (4 bits). The leading zero omitted means only 3 bits? Actually binary representation: 6 decimal = 110 binary (3 bits). So the first hex digit uses 3 bits. So total bits: first digit 3 bits, remaining 4 digits each 4 bits = 3 + 4*4 = 3 + 16 = 19 bits.\n\nCheck: 6 hex = 6 decimal. Binary 110. So we have 19 bits. Let's double-check: 66666 hex = 6*16^4 + 6*16^3 + 6*16^2 + 6*16 + 6. Compute leading power: 16^4=65536. So value ~ 6*65536=393216. plus next 6*4096=24576 -> total 417792. plus 6*256=1536 -> 419328. plus 6*16=96 -> 419424. plus 6=6 -> 419430. That's 419430 decimal. Now binary length? 2^19 = 524288. 2^18=262144. Our number 419430 between 2^18 and 2^19, so needs 19 bits. Good.",
