But maybe leading zero bits may be omitted? But each hex digit gives 4 bits, but the first hex digit 6 in binary is 0110, but leading zero omitted so actually 3 bits? Wait 6 decimal binary is 110. So hex digit 6 -> binary 0110, but leading zero omitted so 3 bits. So total bits: first digit gives 3 bits, rest 4 bits each: 3 + 4*4 = 3 + 16 = 19 bits. Thus answer 19.",
