Compute:\n\n16^0=1\n16^1=16\n16^2=256\n16^3=4096\n16^4=65536\n\nSum = 65536+4096+256+16+1= 699+? wait compute: 65536+4096=69632; +256=69888; +16=69904; +1=69905. Multiply by 6: 69905*6=419430? Let's compute: 69905*6=419430. Yes.\n\nSo decimal value = 419430. Convert to binary length. Let's find highest power of 2 <= 419430. 2^19=524288 >, 2^18=262144, 2^19 too high. So we need up to 18 bits? Actually 262144 <= 419430 < 524288. So binary representation has 19 bits? Since 262144 is 2^18. Next power 2^19 is 524288. So our number is less than 524288, greater than 262144. So the highest bit is 2^18 place. So binary representation will need 19 bits (from 2^0 to 2^18). So answer 19 bits. Check with more precise: 419430 - 262144 = 157286. That's 2^17=131072, remaining 26114; 2^16=65536 too big. 2^15=32768 too big. 2^14=16384 too big. 2^13=8192 fits. So representation uses many bits but count is 19. So answer 19.\n\nCheck: 419430 in binary: 419430 /2 = 209715 remainder 0; 209715 /2=104857 r1; etc. But length 19. So answer: 19.",
