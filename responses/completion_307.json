  "cot_content": "We need to convert 0x66666 from hex to binary and count bits. Hex digits: 6 6 6 6 6. Each hex digit is 4 bits. So 5 hex digits -> 20 bits. But some leading bits may be zero? Actually hex '6' is binary 0110. So first digit '6' leading bits: 0110, so first bit is 0, but we consider representation without leading zeros. The number 0x66666 = decimal? Let's compute: 6*16^4+6*16^3+6*16^2+6*16+6. 16^2=256,16^3=4096,16^4=65536. So =6*65536=393216; +6*4096=24576 -> total 417792; +6*256=1536 -> 419328; +6*16=96 ->419424; +6=419430. So decimal 419430. Now binary length: floor(log2(419430))+1. 419430 approx 2^19=524288. 2^18=262144. So between 2^18 and 2^19. 419430-262144=157286. So it's >2^18. So bit length = 19? Since 2^18 <= n <2^19 => need 19 bits. Let's confirm: 2^19=524288, so 419430 less. So highest set bit position is 18 (0-index). So number of bits = 19. Therefore answer 19.",
