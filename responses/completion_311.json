  "cot_content": "We need to compute number of bits in binary representation of hex number 66666 (hex). Convert to decimal? 0x66666 in hex equals? Let's compute: hex digits: 6 6 6 6 6. Each digit 0-15. So value = 6*16^4 + 6*16^3 + 6*16^2 + 6*16 + 6. Compute: 16^2=256, 16^3=4096, 16^4=65536. So 6*65536=393216. 6*4096=24576. 6*256=1536. 6*16=96. +6=6. Sum: 393216+24576=417792. +1536=419328. +96=419424. +6=419430. So value decimal = 419430. Need binary representation length. Determine highest power of 2 less than or equal to 419430. Compute powers: 2^19=524288; 2^18=262144; 2^19 too high, so highest power <= 419430 is 2^18=262144. Next 2^19 is higher. So binary length = 19 bits? Wait: if number >= 2^18 then needs 19 bits? Actually if value is between 2^18 and 2^19-1 inclusive, binary representation has 19 bits. Because highest bit position is 18 (0-index). So bits count = 19. Let's verify: 2^18 = 262144, 2^19 = 524288. 419430 between. So need 19 bits. Answer: 19.",
