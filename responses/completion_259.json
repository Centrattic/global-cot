So the number in decimal is sum 6*16^4 + 6*16^3 + 6*16^2 + 6*16 + 6. Compute: 16^0=1: 6*1=6. 16^1=16: 6*16=96. 16^2=256: 6*256=1536. 16^3=4096: 6*4096=24576. 16^4=65536: 6*65536=393216. Sum: 393216+24576=417792; +1536=419328; +96=419424; +6=419430. So decimal 419430. Need number of bits needed to represent this in binary. We can compute highest power of 2 <= 419430. Let's find log2. 2^19=524288. Wait 2^18=262144. 2^19=524288 > 419430. So need bits up to 18? Let's check 2^18=262144. 2^19=524288. 419430 between. So number of bits required is 19: because you need bits from 0 to 18 inclusive? Actually to represent any number less than 2^n, you need n bits. For example, 419430 < 524288 = 2^19, but > 262144 = 2^18. So you need 19 bits. Because with 18 bits you can represent up to 2^18-1=262143. So not enough. So answer: 19 bits.",
