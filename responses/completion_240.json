  "cot_content": "We need to compute number of bits of the number represented by hex 66666 (base-16). Convert to decimal? Actually number in hex: digits 6 6 6 6 6. That's 5 hex digits, each 4 bits, so 20 bits total. But leading zeros may not be used. Highest digit is 6, which in binary is 0110. So the most significant 4-bit group is 0110, so leading zero. So the number uses maybe 19 bits? Actually 6 in hex is 0110. So if the first digit is 6 (not zero), but its binary representation is 0110, but we don't count leading zero? The number starts with 0110..., but the first bit is 0? Wait hex digit 6 is 0110. The leading zero is not required? Suppose we write 66666 hex as binary: 6=0110, so the first digit 6 corresponds to 0110. So the full binary string would be 0110 0110 0110 0110 0110. That's 20 bits. But leading zero at the beginning could be omitted, giving 19 bits. But is that allowed? Typically we don't write leading zeros. So the number would start with 1? But the first bit is 0? Let's see: 0110... The first bit of the first group is 0, but that is leading zero. So effectively the number uses 19 bits: first bit after leading zero. However, 6 hex digit yields 0110; the leading zero is optional. So the number in binary representation would be 1100110011001100110? Let's compute: 0110 0110 0110 0110 0110. Remove leading zero: 1100110011001100110. That's 19 bits. So answer 19.",
